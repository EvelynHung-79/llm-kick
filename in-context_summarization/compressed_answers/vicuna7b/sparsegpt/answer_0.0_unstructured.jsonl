However, the country has been struggling to meet expectations in the pool, with only one gold medal and disappointing performances from swimmers like James Magnussen. The lackluster performance has led to an identity crisis in Australia, with critics blaming the media for its negative coverage and placing too much emphasis on winning gold. Sailor Mitchell Watt criticized the media for portraying silver and bronze medals as disappointing, while swimmer Sally Pearson and hurdler Mitchell Watt have also expressed their frustration with the public's reaction to the team's performance. To prevent another national humiliation at the Commonwealth Games in two years, Swimming Australia has commissioned a review led by former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill. The review aims to identify the reason for the team's poor performance in London and find ways to prevent it from happening again. The review will also look into issues such as team unity, pre-event tweeting, work ethic, and the possibility of bearded swimmers being forced to shave. Olympic swimmer Sam Stosur, who was bundled out in the first round of the Australian Open after her US Open victory, has also experienced the impact of high expectations.

{"question_id": 76, "text": "The Kansas City Royals, who had a great run from 1976 to 1985, ended their 29-year drought in the World Series by defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series. The Royals' success can be attributed to their strong defense, smart draft picks, and nifty trades, as their star players are not well-known outside of the baseball world. The team has also shown resilience, rallying from a 35-game stretch where they made 35 errors to win 11 straight games in the postseason. Former Royal Bo Jackson praised the team for their enjoyment of the game and lack of pressure, while former player George Brett, a fan favorite, said that the Royals have \"been around so long, they're like a family.\" The Royals have advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1985, and they are ready to bring the title back to Kansas City.", "answer_id": "4e7LW2anDx2JARW2CNWQx7", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 77, "text": "In 2010, William Darelle Smith was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, his conviction was recently overturned by the state's Supreme Court due to a juror's improper communication with a key prosecution witness, Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified. The juror, identified as Glenn Scott Mitchell, sent a laudatory message to Dr. Lewis on Facebook during the trial, saying she did a great job on the witness stand. The trial court did not hold a hearing to address this communication, and the appeals court ruled that it was just \"mere interactions.\" However, the state Supreme Court overruled this decision and concluded that the trial court should have taken steps to assure that the juror had not been exposed to extraneous information or had not been improperly influenced. The court stressed that the trial court should have held a hearing to address the issue and that trial courts should give jurors specific, understandable instructions that prohibit extrajudicial communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence.", "answer_id": "iawS69AK2Ny8TKiJJXKzQD", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3", "metadata": {}}

The Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the singer, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood. Since then, there have been efforts to keep his memory and music alive, including a $275 million estate, a Cirque du Soleil show, and a new album. However, there are also legal entanglements surrounding his death, including a lawsuit filed by his mother and a wrongful death lawsuit filed by his father. Despite this, people continue to make money off of Jackson, including investors who plan to use a sale of photos to fund a motor that generates more electricity than it uses.

{"question_id": 81, "text": "The \"nuclear option\" refers to changing the Senate's rules to require only 51 votes for confirming judicial and executive nominees, instead of the current 60 votes. This would fundamentally change the character of the chamber, allowing the majority party to confirm nominees with a simple majority. The move has been controversial, with some arguing that it would undermine the minority party's ability to block legislation. However, the Constitution does not specify the rules for Senate proceedings, leaving the power to determine rules in the hands of senators. The use of the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to limit debate, has been a point of contention for years, with some arguing that it has been abused. The current fight is centered on the D.C. Circuit Court, but it extends beyond that, with both parties accusing the other of abusing the filibuster.", "answer_id": "bYuF8a9pLRfjjiojekrcZa", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3", "metadata": {}}

Huckabee is known for his Conservative views and is not a fan of reality television or Rihanna's style. He compares government without checks and balances to \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off on steroids.\" Huckabee is also not pleased with outside conservative groups that he views as \"pay for play.\" He has positive things to say about some potential 2016 opponents, but has no mention of Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or Rand Paul and implicitly knocks the prospect that they all might run for president while serving in the Senate.

{"question_id": 85, "text": "The Islamic State (ISIS) is actively recruiting young Americans to join their cause in Syria and Iraq, and some have already joined. This has raised concerns among officials as ISIS has been successful in Europe. Federal, state and local organizations, including law enforcement agencies, are working together to combat the threat. The situation is worrisome as young people are acquiring radicalized beliefs without committing crimes.\n\nTo prevent violent ideologies from taking root, countering violent extremism (CVE) is being used as a strategy. This involves engagement and partnership with communities, similar to community-oriented policing methods. The LAPD has established a Liaison Section of its Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau to improve public safety and build trust with diverse communities.\n\nCommunity-led CVE initiatives, such as \"Safe Spaces,\" are being rolled out across the US to increase Muslim-American communities' resilience against violent extremism. These initiatives teach helpful strategies to increase parental involvement and supportive adult mentorship for youth. Communities are also forming \"crisis inquiry teams\" to identify individuals believed to be at risk of engaging in violent beliefs and help them turn away from that path.\n\nOpinion: The US government needs to build on the successes in these cities and learn from other countries such as Australia, Canada, and Britain. It is essential to increase knowledge of CVE strategies, accelerate implementation efforts, and measure the effectiveness of different CVE initiatives.", "answer_id": "JP8Fb2KijGUFzHw46WLFac", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3", "metadata": {}}
