Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called Saturday's talks \"a first step,\" adding, \"we welcome further steps.\"\"We are ready to discuss ideas to move forward, make sure that people are not harmed any more, that this conflict comes to an end and that the damaged relationship between Libya and the (United) States and other NATO countries can be repaired,\" Ibrahim said.But in Washington, a U.S. official familiar with the meeting said the purpose of the meeting was \"for us to convey directly that Gadhafi must go.\" And a senior State Department official called the three-hour session in Tunis \"a one-time meeting to send a clear message,\" not the start of negotiations.NATO has been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi, who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country. Libyan officials had been reaching out to Washington with increasing frequency in recent weeks with no response, said the State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.After Friday's announcement that the United States would recognize the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya's rightful government, the official said the Obama administration wanted to tell the Libyans face-to-face what it has been saying publicly: that Gadhafi must go.Saturday's meeting was \"a straightforward effort to send a very clear message to the Gadhafi regime,\" the official said.

Ahead of the decision, the opposition New Democratic Party accused his government of \"standing up for big polluters\" at the expense of ordinary Canadians and risking the country's reputation by abandoning the 1997 treaty.Kent said Kyoto's goals were unworkable because the United States and China -- the world's two largest sources of carbon emissions -- never agreed to Kyoto, and that a new pact is needed to address emissions from rapidly growing economies including those of China, Brazil and India.Special: The Road to DurbanThe government announced in 2010 that it would fall well short of the treaty's target of a 6% cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2012. Kent said the previous government signed onto the treaty \"without any regard to how it would be fulfilled,\" and that Canadians faced \"radical\" cuts or financial penalties equivalent to $1,600 per family as a result.He said Canada was \"well on our way\" to reducing emissions by 17% over 2005 levels by 2020, but critics say that self-imposed goal is well below the Kyoto targets.Nations in the Durban talks agreed to extend Kyoto's efforts over the weekend and launched an effort to set up a broader pact with a legal format to curb carbon emissions.The talks also launched a Green Climate Fund, which would essentially channel about $100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change.@highlightEnvironment minister says Canada will still work to reduce greenhouse emissions@highlightHe says previous government should not have agreed to Kyoto@highlightKyoto's goals unworkable without the United States and China, he says", "category": "small"}

Both of those stadiums are roughly 50 years old.The retractable roof over Arthur Ashe alone is expected to cost in excess of $100 million.The men's governing body in the U.S. will \"self-finance\" the project through a combination of bonds and \"USTA revenue generation,\" it said in a statement.\"We have been working toward a viable design for a roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium for more than a decade,\" USTA chairman and president Dave Haggerty said in the statement. \"Through a long and arduous process, we feel that we now have a design that meets the criteria of being architecturally sound, aesthetically pleasing, reasonably affordable and buildable.\"Players including women's No. 1 Serena Williams welcomed the news, which likely will mean the tournament won't enter a 15th day.The previous five editions have seen Monday men's finals because of rain, in some cases leading to an unfair advantage for one of the participants in the finale.In 2008, while Roger Federer was already through to the final after completing his semifinal on a Saturday, Andy Murray had to finish his semifinal a day later due to bad weather before contesting the final on the Monday.\"Obviously it's going to be great,\" Williams told reporters in Cincinnati, where she is competing at the Western & Southern Open. \"It's good to know they're going for it.\"When I first started playing the Open back in the '90s, it didn't rain and now it rains only on the final weekend. Last four U.S. Opens I've played, they've had to change completely the schedule.\"You just got to keep moving with the times,\" said Williams, who missed the 2010 U.S. Open due to a foot injury.Murray, however, said having a roof wasn't without its negatives.\"I don't necessarily miss being rained off, but rain delays used to be part of (grand slams),\" Murray told reporters in Cincinnati. \"That's kind of going away gradually.\"I don't particularly like going from indoors to outdoors. It's also so tough. But it's good for TV.\"The USTA has indeed for years looked into having a retractable roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium -- which seats 22,500 fans -- but it was thought the extra weight couldn't be supported. Technological and engineering advances have now made the work possible.By the time all the enhancements are completed, it's anticipated that an extra 10,000 fans per day will be able watch the tennis on site.Tennis' other major, the French Open, is hoping to have a roof in place for 2018 although that is not guaranteed.Tsonga pulls out of New YorkJo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, is skipping this year's U.S. Open because of the knee injury that forced him to retire at Wimbledon, he told his website.The entertaining Frenchman was forced to stop against Ernests Gulbis in the second round at the All England Club in June and hasn't played since.\"It would be stupid to go there knowing full well that I have no chance because I'm not prepared enough,\" the world No. 8 said.Although he has yet to win a grand slam -- the French men's drought in singles extends to 30 years -- Tsonga had reached the quarterfinals or better in four of his five majors prior to Wimbledon.He's optimistic of returning in time for an indoor tournament in France in mid-September.This season's U.S. Open begins August 26th.@highlightThe U.S. Open will have a retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium as early as 2016@highlightThe tournament has been affected by rain since 2008, leading to Monday finals@highlightNew and bigger second and third show courts will also be constructed on site@highlightThis year's tournament will be without Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who pulled out injured", "category": "mid"}

Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called Saturday's talks \"a first step,\" adding, \"we welcome further steps.\"\"We are ready to discuss ideas to move forward, make sure that people are not harmed any more, that this conflict comes to an end and that the damaged relationship between Libya and the (United) States and other NATO countries can be repaired,\" Ibrahim said.But in Washington, a U.S. official familiar with the meeting said the purpose of the meeting was \"for us to convey directly that Gadhafi must go.\" And a senior State Department official called the three-hour session in Tunis \"a one-time meeting to send a clear message,\" not the start of negotiations.NATO has been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi, who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country. Libyan officials had been reaching out to Washington with increasing frequency in recent weeks with no response, said the State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.After Friday's announcement that the United States would recognize the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya's rightful government, the official said the Obama administration wanted to tell the Libyans face-to-face what it has been saying publicly: that Gadhafi must go.Saturday's meeting was \"a straightforward effort to send a very clear message to the Gadhafi regime,\" the official said. And after conversations with people who spoke to the Libyans afterward, the Libyans are believed to have heard and understood the U.S. position, the official said.Ibrahim said in June that Libya would not consider a peace initiative that would require Gadhafi to step down.The State Department official said talks involved three American envoys and four Libyan officials.

Ahead of the decision, the opposition New Democratic Party accused his government of \"standing up for big polluters\" at the expense of ordinary Canadians and risking the country's reputation by abandoning the 1997 treaty.Kent said Kyoto's goals were unworkable because the United States and China -- the world's two largest sources of carbon emissions -- never agreed to Kyoto, and that a new pact is needed to address emissions from rapidly growing economies including those of China, Brazil and India.Special: The Road to DurbanThe government announced in 2010 that it would fall well short of the treaty's target of a 6% cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2012. Kent said the previous government signed onto the treaty \"without any regard to how it would be fulfilled,\" and that Canadians faced \"radical\" cuts or financial penalties equivalent to $1,600 per family as a result.He said Canada was \"well on our way\" to reducing emissions by 17% over 2005 levels by 2020, but critics say that self-imposed goal is well below the Kyoto targets.Nations in the Durban talks agreed to extend Kyoto's efforts over the weekend and launched an effort to set up a broader pact with a legal format to curb carbon emissions.The talks also launched a Green Climate Fund, which would essentially channel about $100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change.@highlightEnvironment minister says Canada will still work to reduce greenhouse emissions@highlightHe says previous government should not have agreed to Kyoto@highlightKyoto's goals unworkable without the United States and China, he says", "category": "mid"}

Early speculation centered on the possibility it was shot down at an altitude of more than 30,000 feet.The company confirmed that it lost contact with the flight -- coded MH17. Its last known position was over Ukrainian airspace.The plane is said to have crashed in eastern Ukraine near the border with Russia. Russian-backed separatists are fighting the Ukrainian military in the region.As the tragedy unfolds with the obvious potential for significant wreckage and devastating loss of life, the threat to Malaysia Airlines as a company is potentially greater than any single airline disaster, said corporate turnaround expert Ted Gavin, founding partner and managing director of Gavin/Solmonese.\"This is a potentially fatal event for that airline, but also it's an event for them to redeem themselves in how they deal with information and the public,\" he said.Missing Flight 370In the weeks following the disappearance of Flight 370, some family members of passengers were harshly critical of Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian aviation authorities regarding the investigation.Family members accused airline officials of not offering information about how they responded immediately after the plane disappeared. In the months that followed, they expressed distrust of the airline and Malaysia's government.\"The way Malaysia Airlines handled the disappearance of the last jet was a huge hit to confidence,\" said Gavin.In the immediate hours following Thursday's disaster, Gavin said \"the airline needs to share every piece of information and every piece of data they have, including the decision making process that led to that plane flying over a recent conflict region.\"It also must be unashamed to discuss possible mistakes that were made, said Gavin. \"What can't happen is week-long deliberations where families of crash victims don't hear from them or don't know anything.\"\"Frankly this is an opportunity for them to talk about what they've learned and what they've done better and what they've done differently since Flight 370.\"Full storySearchers are apparently no closer to solving the mystery surrounding the Malaysia AIrlines flight which went missing March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew.This month, the airline's main shareholder was considering restructuring the operation and taking it private, the Wall Street Journal reported.The Journal used the words \"turn around\" and \"resuscitate\" to describe the strategy.Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted Thursday that Malaysia is launching an immediate investigation into the loss of Flight 17.In April, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to avoid airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It said the region posed the \"potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities\" and the \"misidentification of civil aircraft.\"It's unknown if Malaysian aviation officials issued a similar warning.The airline still faces possible lawsuits from family members that could total millions of dollars.Boeing's twin-engine 777  boasts an excellent safety record and is among the most sophisticated airliners flying today. Its capacity is between 300 and 450 passengers and a range of about 5,700 miles.\"There have been bad years for commercial aviation,\" Gavin said. \"But for one airline to lose two of the same type of airframe in such a short time span? It's potentially unprecedented for a commercial carrier in the modern aviation age.\"Financial troublesAnalysts said it may take a government rescue to save the company from financial disaster.Malaysia Airlines has faced increased competition in recent years from new regional airlines. It tried to boost revenue by selling more tickets, rather than raising prices, while keeping operating costs under control. It has also canceled some longer flight routes.But the strategy never took hold, and the difficult business climate has forced the airline into the red for the past three years, leading to a loss of about $1.3 billion over that period.The Malaysian government has helped the largely unprofitable airline before, though its previous efforts seemed only to provide temporary respite.Malaysia Air may need government rescueGold prices rally in wake of plane crash@highlightAnalyst: Loss of two Boeing 777s in 131 days could deal fatal blow to Malaysia Airlines@highlightMalaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in eastern Ukraine@highlightThe airlines is still struggling to overcome harsh criticism over its handling of Flight 370@highlightIt has also had serious financial problems in recent years", "category": "mid"}

Then I saw a low flying object. It was skimming across the sky towards the turbines.\"Apparently, hours later, she and her husband were woken by a big bang; one of the turbine's three blades had gone.It, was, however, on the ground below.Other locals told the newspaper that the lights looked like \"balls of flames.\"Russ Kellett, a UFO expert, told the newspaper: \"Balls of light were seen in the sky and the MoD [Ministry of Defence] has no explanation. It must have taken a pretty massive object. We are very, very, very excited.\"However, The Guardian newspaper's Web site content director Emily Bell had a simple explanation for all those \"balls of light\" in the sky.She told The Guardian the lights were fireworks her brother Tim had bought at the local garden center for the 80th birthday party of dad Peter Bell.\"It was a medium-sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics, and the fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents' house. But we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine,\" Emily said.\"There we are in the middle of a scoop and we're beaten to it by a red-top tabloid,\" Emily's mother Bridget, 74, told The Guardian.Later Thursday, the British Press Association reported the blade may have come off after a mechanical failure.Fraser McLachlan, chief executive of GCube, which insures more than 25,000 wind turbines worldwide, told PA that although it was unusual, this kind of incident happened up to six times a year.\"It does happen that a blade will sometimes just come off a machine for one reason or another,\" he said. \"The main reason is the blade may shear. \"We don't normally see things like aircraft -- or UFOs -- hitting them. It's usually a mechanical failure that causes the blade to separate from the main hub.\"He said the cold weather was another possible cause.Dr Peter Schubel, an expert in the design and manufacture of wind turbine blades at the University of Nottingham, agreed.He told the BBC that if the turbine blade was still, it would take a 10-tonne load to remove a blade, but if it was rotating the force could be a lot less.\"It's definitely not a bird.

Court officials then read out the findings of their lengthy investigation.Prosecutors contend Duch ran S-21, a prison that had been converted from a school. Here, men, women and children were shackled to iron beds and tortured -- before they were beaten to death, prosecutors said.Many of the victims were military officials or Communist Party members targeted for not going along with the philosophy of the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge movement, prosecutors said.Duch faces charges that include crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and murder.He has admitted his role in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal reign.

Hormel Foods sells more product in Hawaii per person than in any other U.S. state. According to the Spam Jam website, almost seven million cans of the stuff are eaten in Hawaii every year.The festival's dozen or so vendors demonstrate the meat-product's unexpected versatility.\"This year, we had Spam cheesecake and Spam ice cream. In the past, we've had Spam ravioli, Spam kotsu, Spam poki, Spam French fries -- pretty much everything can be made with Spam,\" says Winpenny.Foods represented at festivals can range from the more mundane -- melons, pumpkins, potatoes -- to the downright daring. In West Virginia, locals are keen to celebrate a local delicacy -- road kill. Last week saw the kick off of Clinton, MT's Testy Festy, a celebration of Rocky Mountain Oysters, aka bull testicles. Next month, adventurous eaters can sample scorpions at Bugfest in North Carolina.However, there are times when imbibing our favorite foods is not enough. Sometimes, it seems, making a mess is the only way to do it justice. Several festivals demand participants get dirty. La Tomatina -- where thousands travel to Spain to engage in a bustling tomato fight -- is perhaps the most famous of these, though there are many instances in which festival-goers feel the need to rollick around in grub.On August 23, Barnesville, Minnesota, will celebrate Potato Days, an annual two-day festival dedicated to the humble tuber. No matter how many activities the organizers introduce, however, the most popular remains the mashed potato wrestling competition.\"It's quite a sight to watch people wrestling around in mashed potatoes,\" admits Theresa Olson, the festival's executive director. \"Afterward, they find mashed potato everywhere.\"The festival started in 1951 as a source of post-harvest entertainment. Back then, the activities were limited to a potato picking contest for the men, and a peeling competition for the women. Since then, it's matured, and events include a cook-off, a mashed potato sculpting contest and a potato sack fashion show.Read more: The world's messiest festivals\"It's often voted one of the best festivals in America, partly because it's family friendly, and it's free,\" says Olson.In some instances, culinary celebrations act as a historic link. In Bessieres, France, the townspeople make a giant omelet every Easter to feed the poor, a tradition that supposedly started when Napoleon and his army stopped in the town for the night. Legend has it that The Little Corporal ordered the villagers to gather all their eggs to make an omelet for his army.The celebration has since spread to French-speaking communities across the globe. In Abbeville, Louisiana, the town launched their own version of the tradition (albeit with a Creole twist).\"It's grown to seven cities throughout the world, and we each add a local ingredient,\" says Arlene White, the third Grand Maitre of Abbeville's Giant Omelette Celebration. The town uses 5,000 eggs, and adds Tabasco and crayfish to make it their own.While there are many who would argue that food is art, some regions take this line of thinking to a new level. At the R\u00e4bechilbi Turnip Festival in Switzerland, for instance, locals create elaborate floats using 40 tons of hallowed out turnips. In the past, they've created replicas of panthers, windmills, ships, whales -- even Amy Winehouse. Though the tiny town of Richterswil houses a meager 12,000 residents, the festival attracts 20,000 visitors each year.\"We're a small village, so you can imagine how crowded it gets,\" says Mich\u00e8le Fasler, a spokeswoman for R\u00e4bechilbi.Fasler describes the atmosphere as warm and peaceful. Just don't eat the turnips, she warns.\"It's not good for your stomach,\" she says. \"It's like eating too much beans.\"@highlightHawaii is America's largest consumer of Spam.

The bone-conduction speaker, which, similar to some hearing aids, literally sends sound waves through the skull to the ear, has been called faulty by some testers.The swap begins Friday and testers will have 60 days to decide if they want new Glass.The roughly 10,000 current testers also be able to invite up to three friends into the program, which requires testers to fork over the current $1,500 price of the glasses.\"Over the next few weeks, all Explorers will have the opportunity to invite three friends to join the program,\" the post said. \"They'll be able to buy Glass online and can have it shipped to their home, office, treehouse or igloo.

She then went into labor during a papal procession and the mob descended on her and her child, ending her reign.Diarmaid MacCulloch, a theologian and historian from Oxford University, said the story of Pope Joan is a myth, nothing but satirical fiction.\"It keeps appealing to new anxieties and new interests,\" he said. \"So first it's medieval people who resented the papacy. Then it's Protestants. Then it's French revolutionaries who want to discredit the church.\"The next constituency is actually Catholics who want to see women priests. And this seems to me the most dangerous aspect of the story, because it's using a story which is patently nonsense to boost a good cause.\"But Pope Joan still has her believers. Why, they ask, were cardinals asked to sit on a uniquely shaped chair well into the 16th century? Was it a birthing chair? Or, as legend holds, a specially designed seat for checking the next Pope had the right, shall we say, equipment for the job?What about the peculiarly named Vicus Papissa, or Road of the Lady Pope, a medieval alleyway shunned by papal processions? This, according to legend, is where Pope Joan came to an end. There is even a shrine said to be dedicated to her and her child.Historians say the road is named not for Pope Joan, but for the Pape family that lived there. Still, the legend endures, as do calls for women to break through the stained-glass ceiling and have a greater say in the church.At Rome's Church of St. Lucia, the art on the walls highlights the central role that women have had in the church's past. Catholics revere Mary, the mother of Jesus, and church history is replete with female saints who struggled and died for the faith. Others refused to stay silent when they saw evil in the church's ranks: In the 14th century, St. Catherine of Siena famously called the cardinals \"devils in human form.\"\"Everyone would like to have more women everywhere, because this is a fact that is not possible to stop: Nowadays, women are very, very strong,\" said Alessandra Candrelli, one of the many women worshiping at the Church of St. Lucia.A bit of female advice might help the church steer its way through troubled waters, said Donna Orsuto, a professor from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.\"It certainly brings more balance when you have contact with women and when you listen to women especially and listen to their perspective,\" she said. \"And I think a lot of the ways that this (abuse) crisis was handled in the church, to have had more women's input in dealing with it would have been a better thing.\"Who are the front-runners to replace Benedict XVI?Sister Mary Ann Walsh of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops concedes that the church's hierarchy is male-dominated, but said women do occupy important lay positions in Catholic social and relief organizations.\"If you take ordination off the table, in the U.S. our statistics are better than the Department of Labor when it comes to women in executive positions,\" Walsh said.For now, however, women have at best an indirect influence on the Vatican's upper echelon.\"Certainly the church is not a democratic society in the way civil society understands,\" said Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins of Portugal. \"It's a hierarchical church, therefore not everyone is equal.\"Women's voices might be louder than before, but will there ever be a female pope? MacCulloch said he could see it happening one day.\"It's surprising how quickly these things happen once the idea gets around,\" he said. \"But don't hold your breath.\"@highlightThe Vatican's upper echelon appears to be an exclusive men's club@highlightWomen aren't allowed to be ordained as priests, so they cannot become pope@highlightStill, many women hold executive lay positions in Catholic organizations@highlightSome believe there was once a female pope; movies have been made about the medieval tale", "category": "mid"}

The donor was a 20-year-old airman who was training to be an aviation mechanic in Pensacola, and the recipient was a retired Army veteran, according to the Department of Defense.Doctors knew the donor had encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when they harvested the organs. However, no rabies test was done before the before the donor's kidneys, heart and liver were delivered for transplantation in September 2011, the CDC said.4 shots enough to ward off rabiesThe Maryland recipient died February 27 at the VA Medical Center in Washington, and doctors at the CDC diagnosed rabies as the cause of death. The CDC then examined autopsy tissue from the donor and determined he had died of the same type of rabies, which is spread by raccoons, according to the CDC.Health officials immediately contacted doctors caring for the other three organ recipients. They show no signs of rabies but are being treated with five doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin, which gives the body antibodies to protect itself against the rabies virus. Both treatments are shots in the upper arm.Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue Safety, said the recipients' doctors were shocked to learn the donor's organs were tainted with rabies.\"Their first reaction was that it seemed unlikely because it's been almost a year and a half since the transplant,\" he said.In the only other U.S. outbreak of rabies among organ recipients, the four patients died within a month of transplant in 2004.The three other recipients are being tested for rabies, and health authorities are looking for family members or health care workers who might have had close contact with the donor or the recipient who died to see if they might also have the disease, said CDC spokeswoman Melissa Dankel.Why organs aren't tested for rabiesBefore the airman died in Florida, he was experiencing \"changes in mental status,\" according to Kuehnert. He said the donor tested negative for several causes of encephalitis, including West Nile Virus and herpes.Organ donors are not routinely tested for rabies, even if they show the signs. One reason is rabies is extremely rare, with only one to three cases a year nationwide, according to Dr. Richard Franka, the CDC's acting rabies team lead.Also, many lifesaving organs would be lost if donors were tested for rabies. Only three or four facilities in the country are capable of testing for rabies in humans, Franka said, which means most hospitals would have to ship a potential donor's blood or tissue. It could take two days to get test results, and by then the organs would no longer be usable.Kuehnert said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis and no one knows why.\"What we need looking forward is a standardized approach when you have encephalitis of unknown cause so very important things like this aren't missed,\" he said.At least one transplant surgeon won't take organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown origin.Dr. Amy Friedman, director of transplantation at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, said the risk is too big.But she added that she does kidney transplants, and her patients can survive, at least in the short term, on dialysis. Other patients waiting for organs such as hearts or livers might die quickly without a transplant -- and sometimes the only organ available is one where the patient died of encephalitis and no one knows why.Those patients should be fully informed so they can decide if they want to take the risk, she wrote in a blog post Friday.\"Statistically it's quite likely the organ could be fine, but if it's not, everybody has trouble,\" she told CNN.CNN's Miriam Falco, Val Willingham and Georgiann Caruso contributed to this report.@highlightA Maryland man who received a tainted organ in 2011 died last month@highlightOfficials determined the organ donor had rabies@highlightThree other people in Florida, Georgia and Illinois are receiving anti-rabies shots", "category": "mid"}

In a CNN special that aired on Tuesday, for example, people of color were not as well-represented as American atheism's more familiar face: You know, white males.In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden?There is a harsh truth to face here.Most blacks identify as religious. Belief in God is touted with pride, and the church is intricately tied to tradition, history and culture. It is not uncommon to assume that I attend services as a black woman. The question often isn't if I go to church -- it's where. And even if one doesn't go to church, surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god.All of this makes the words \"black\" and \"atheist\" hard for many to imagine in the same sentence.It can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community. Many have social, emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution, so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason.To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online.Though I was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- I've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist. However, my journey is far from tragic. In founding my organization, Black Nonbelievers, in 2011, I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself, or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind. And they have done so bravely, defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion.The Friendly Atheists Next DoorMy experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated, and even ignored.On the one hand, there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us. On the other hand, there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address. The lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing, but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care. We are sometimes treated as if we are invisible, or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome.Fortunately, all is not lost. Progress has been made. There are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color, women and children.There is a more concentrated focus on support for the LGBT demographic, as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds. There are support systems for people who have lost loved ones, yet they have no religious affiliation. Moreover, there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent. Such representation is now reflected at organized events, in leadership, as well as in media coverage.While the number of visible minority atheists is still small, we are here and we're here to stay.We will continue to grow, in both the black and secular communities. We can lead the charge for this change. The more we make our presence known, the better our chances of working together to turn around the disparities we face, and bolster the recognition we so rightly deserve. We are not alone.@highlightAfrican-American atheists represent a small but growing segment of American atheists at large@highlightMost blacks, though, identify as religious, and the church is intricately tied to tradition, history and culture", "category": "mid"}

Facing challenges in other parts of the world, and having sold its Russian joint venture TNK-BP, it sees the US as central to its plans for future growth.However, the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon still overshadows the company's prospects. In its settlement last year with the US Department of Justice of the criminal charges against it, BP admitted that negligence on the part of its employees -- along with other companies -- was a \"proximate cause\" of the accident.That led to debarment from new federal contracts, which means that BP cannot take out any new drilling leases in the gulf until the ban is lifted.The DoJ said last year in a memo filed to the court in New Orleans hearing the civil case over the spill that it planned to prove BP had acted with \"gross negligence or wilful misconduct\" that had caused the accident. BP denies this gross negligence.The Deepwater Horizon disaster followed other failures including a leak from a pipeline in Alaska in 2006 and the Texas City refinery explosion in 2005, which killed 15 people in one of the US's worst industrial accidents of recent years.After those accidents Tony Hayward, who took over as chief executive in 2007, promised to restructure the company to focus on safety \"like a laser\".Mr Morrison said the company had been pushing ahead with those changes, which had not been fully implemented at the time of the Deepwater Horizon accident, and introducing new systems and technologies as a result of the lessons it had learnt from its investigation of the disaster.For example, he said staff of BP's new Safety and Operational Risk organisation, set up by Mr Hayward's successor Bob Dudley in 2011, now had the authority to order that an operation be stopped, when the previous safety body had more of an advisory role.Another change was that the importance of process safety -- focusing on an operation as a whole, rather than small individual accidents -- was one of the lessons of the Texas City disaster and has now been emphasised in the drilling operations as well as BP's refineries, Mr Morrison said.\u00a9 The Financial Times Limited 2013@highlightUK oil group claims it has drilling safety systems ahead of any other company's@highlightBP blamed in large part for 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in Gulf of Mexico@highlightBP has new unit monitoring wells being drilled offshore, training facility@highlightDoJ: BP acted with \"gross negligence\" for its part in Deepwater Horizon spill", "category": "mid"}

Officials have tried to interview her -- even compelling the agent to get her on the phone -- but have not been able to talk to her yet, the sources said.\"The reason this is troubling is that these women are really unknown to our law enforcement personnel,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the use of prostitutes by Secret Service agents in Colombia before President Barack Obama's visit there last month.\"We don't know if they are associated with drug cartels.  Whether they have been sent into entrap the agents or compromise them in some way which could endanger their mission -- whether it's protecting the president in the case of the Secret Service agents, or whether it's pursuing drug activities in the case of the DEA agents.\"The DEA agents were not involved in the security for the president's trip, the government sources said.The DEA agent's relationship with the prostitute came to light after a Secret Service agent voluntarily reported to his superiors that he was at a party at the agents' Cartagena apartment on April 13 with the three DEA agents and several women, according to the government sources.  One of the sources said the Secret Service agent reported that he went into a bedroom with one of the women and had \"a massage with a sexual aspect to it.\"Later, the Secret Service agent witnessed the women he was with being paid in local currency by one of the DEA agents, the sources said.  But the Secret Service agent has insisted to investigators that it was not his intention to pay for sex.\"Because of all the pressure, he wanted to self-report and basically confess that this had occurred instead of getting caught,\" said a government source who described the Secret Service agent as \"guilt-ridden.\"The Secret Service agent is the 13th agency employee to get caught up in the Colombia prostitution scandal. He is currently on administrative leave but is not expected to lose his job because he came forward on his own to report the incident, according to several sources.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-New York, told CNN the Secret Service agent took and passed a polygraph test.  But he said the alleged behavior by the DEA agents puts lives at risk.King said any time U.S government personnel are \"involved in any sexual manner...you are leaving yourself, at the very least, you're opening yourself to blackmail.

Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan will testify at the hearing in his first public appearance before Congress about the incident.In remarks prepared for delivery as her opening statement at the hearing, Collins says, \"This reckless behavior could easily have compromised individuals charged with the security of the president of the United States.\"She adds, \"The facts so far lead me to conclude that, while not at all representative of the majority of Secret Service personnel, this misconduct was almost certainly not an isolated incident.\"@highlightSources cite potential for agents being blackmailed by drug cartels or other criminals@highlightThe Colombia prostitution scandal will be the subject of a Senate committee hearing@highlightSen.

Anti-government protesters, still intent on ousting Yingluck, now congregate at central Bangkok's Lumpini Park.\"Provided the protests remain subdued then we believe tourism in Bangkok (it was relatively unaffected in the rest of the country and in the beach resorts) will gradually pick up,\" Andrew Yates, head of equities at Asia Plus Securities, told CNN.The lifting of the emergency degree should also have a positive impact on the conference and incentive travel business, which brings a lot of high end travelers to Thailand, he said.\"These trips are generally discretionary travel or can be relocated quite easily,\" said Yates.\"They are extremely sensitive to political disturbances or health issues like SARS and avian flu.\"Insurance is another major issue for many tour groups, as travel insurance tends to be invalidated by civil disturbances and a state of emergency would meet the definition of most policies, he said.\"Even though a tourist's chances of being killed or injured in a protest are slight, it happened to several in 1991, and most tour operators won't take any chances. There is also the risk of being stuck, if airports are shut down.\"Travel advisories now a key issue\"The removal of the state of emergency decree is clearly encouraging for Thai Tourism stakeholders,\" Martin Craigs, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), told CNN.\"However the key issue is how this will effect travel advisories.\"Yates had a similar take.\"Thailand would want to see either a lifting or easing of the travel warnings issued by various embassies, this should help [win] back the mass market tourists, especially from China who are more concerned with safety than a cheap room,\" he said.\"These warnings were in relation to the street protests, not the SOE itself.\"More than 40 countries issued warnings to their citizens relating to Bangkok since protests began in November.In January, Hong Kong gave the Thai capital a \"black\" designation -- a dubious honor shared only with Egypt, the Philippines and Syria.Martin says PATA research showed air travel bookings from Hong Kong to Thailand went down in January over 50%. On Wednesday, Hong Kong updated its warning.\"In view of the latest situation in Bangkok, and the fact that the state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces was lifted by the Thai Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government today (March 19) adjusted the Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) for Thailand (Bangkok) to amber -- the same as for other parts of Thailand,\" said a government spokesman.Thailand's Tourism Authority is reportedly now planning a large marketing campaign to promote the country globally.

He had been infected with Ebola in Liberia, where he worked as a top government official in the Liberian Ministry of Finance.Sawyer was isolated at a local Nigerian hospital on July 20. He died five days later.Sawyer's wife Decontee Sawyer, lives in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, with the couple's three young daughters, 5-year-old Eva, 4-year-old Mia, and Bella, who is 1. The Sawyers are naturalized citizens; their daughters were born in the United States.\"He was so proud when he became a U.S. citizen,\" Decontee told CNN. \"He voted for first time in the last U.S. presidential election. He lived in the U.S. for many years, and wanted that for Liberia -- a better democracy.\"Sawyer had been caring for his Ebola-stricken sister in Liberia, Decontee said, though at the time he didn't know she had Ebola.Sawyer is the first American to die in what health officials are calling the \"deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.\" His death has sparked concerns that the virus could potentially spread to the United States.\"People weren't really taking it [Ebola] seriously until it hit Patrick,\" Decontee said. \"People are ready to take action.\"Let's take a step back and look at what we know about the Ebola outbreak:Where is it happening?Up until this past week, the Ebola outbreak had been contained to three West African countries: Guinea, where it began, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Sawyer is the first known case outside of these three countries.As of July 23, the World Health Organization had confirmed more than 800 Ebola cases in the region, but suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be more like 1,200 cases. Sierra Leone has been hardest hit with approximately 525 cases.How many people have died?The World Health Organization says as of July 23, there have been 456 confirmed Ebola deaths, and another 216 suspected deaths, bringing the number possibly to more than 670.The country of Guinea has the most suspected deaths. The epidemic has been in that country longer. It is believed the epidemic began in the nation's capital of Conakry.While international leaders have mobilized to fight the epidemic, it can be a difficult one to stop. It is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90% of those who catch it. The death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60% since it has been treated early in many instances. There is, however, no Ebola vaccination.Have other Americans been infected?Last week, two American aid workers in Liberia's capital city, Monrovia, were confirmed to have the disease. Doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected. It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person's bodily fluids.Dr. Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old Fort Worth, Texas, resident, had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia when he started to feel sick.Brantly works with Samaritan's Purse, a Christian international relief agency. He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia and has been working to help Ebola patients since October. After testing positive for Ebola, Brantly went into treatment at ELWA Hospital.Samaritan's Purse has been working to evacuate him for better care, said Ken Isaacs, vice president of the agency. Unfortunately, emergency medical evacuation flights in the area are not equipped to handle the \"intense isolation\" required for an Ebola patient.Brantly's family had been with him in Liberia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but left for the United States before he became symptomatic; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him. Out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21-day fever watch, the CDC said.\"We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support,\" the Brantly family said in a statement. \"Kent remains very physically weak, but his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal.\"Nancy Writebol from Charlotte, North Carolina, has also been infected. She is employed by Serving in Mission, or SIM, and had teamed up with the staff from Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick. She, too, is undergoing treatment.It is believed one of the local staff was infected with Ebola and came to work with the virus on Monday and Tuesday, Isaacs told CNN.\"We think it was in the scrub-down area where the disease was passed to both Nancy and Kent,\" he said. That staff member died on Thursday.Both Brantly and Writebol are stable, according to a statement released Tuesday by SIM, though both patients are still exhibiting symptoms of the virus.\"Due to the upsurge in cases of Ebola in the region, SIM and Samaritan's Purse have taken the precautionary step of mandating the evacuation of all nonessential personnel from Liberia,\" the statement said. \"Timing, means, and place of evacuation are being decided now.\"Could Ebola spread to the U.S.?The CDC held a media briefing Monday to emphasize that there is \"no significant risk\" of an Ebola outbreak in the United States.There has never been a confirmed case of Ebola spreading to a developed country, said Kamiliny Kalahne, an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders.\"This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick, have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations, they don't travel.\"And even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country, they will be in a good hospital with good infection control, so they are very unlikely to infect others,\" she said.The U.S. health care system is also better suited to handle an Ebola case than many in West Africa, said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. Health officials would likely recognize such a case and be able to trace all points of contact with the patient to prevent further transmission, he said.\"Epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma,\" Cetron said. \"All of these things occur in a social context that can make containment very challenging.\"That said, Sawyer did end up on an airplane at an international airport: What's to say others might not do the same, and actually make it to the United States?Count CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta among those who believe \"it's going to happen at some point.\"One big reason is that it takes 2 to 21 days between the time a person is infected and when he or she shows symptoms -- including vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding.  Ebola is not contagious until symptoms appear, though that doesn't mean a person cannot travel in the incubation period.\"Just observing the whole process, it's almost impossible to prevent from happening,\" Gupta said. \"But I think ... it can be then stemmed, so it doesn't turn into all these mini-secondary outbreaks.\"What should I do?Avoiding these West African countries is the easiest way to prevent the outbreak from spreading, Cetron said. If you have traveled recently to the region and develop a fever, or other symptoms consistent with Ebola, notify your doctor right away.If you're a humanitarian worker in the region, you need to be familiar with proper infection control precautions and avoid contact with blood or any other bodily fluids, he said. You should also report any needle sticks or possible exposures early to receive testing and, if necessary, start treatment as soon as possible.The Sawyer family is working with their church community to start \"Concerned Liberians against Ebola,\" Decontee said. Their goal is to raise $500,000 to help two international organizations: Samaritan's Purse and Global Health Ministry.How can those with the disease be helped?While experimental vaccines exist, there are no licensed ones that get widespread use, according to the World Health Organization.The disease can be devastating and, ultimately, deadly in a few ways. One is because it \"disarms your immune system, (so it) cannot fight the virus,\" Gupta notes. Another is that it causes people to lose fluids, because of vomiting and diarrhea in addition to bleeding, as Ebola inhibits one's ability to clot, adds Gupta.The most important thing a person needs to do to survive is to get treated as early and effectively as possible.But that's not always easy in some parts of Africa, says Monia Sayah, a nurse with the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.\"We go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome, because they understand now that the survival rate is not very high,\" Sayah told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Sayah acknowledges that, in addition to immediate family members, health care workers are among those at highest risk of being infected. One need look no farther than Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, a doctor who was on the front lines fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone before dying this week from complications of the disease.Health care workers don gowns, gloves and masks, among other measures, to guard against the disease.\"Every inch of the body has to be covered,\" Sayah said. \"It's essential.\"Ebola doctor in Sierra Leone dies@highlightFamily: Infected American \"very physically weak, but his spirit (is) determined\"@highlightCNN's Gupta: Curbing Ebola almost \"impossible,\" but it can be contained@highlightPatrick Sawyer's family lives Minnesota; he worked in Liberia and died in Nigeria@highlightHundreds have been infected with Ebola around Africa", "category": "large"}
{"question_id": 63, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nNew York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today's Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters.The Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack.Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.During the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country.So it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?Not at all.There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We've just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work.Rescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages.And wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren't we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn't it with the promise that we'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up?Maybe it's because they made it look so easy.Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they're doing real work to help people communicate.But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web.We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company.And that's the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.Fortunately there's good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.The reality is social networks come and go.Ten years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy \"AOL keywords.\" These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.But we don't need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.Think how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called \"911\" instead of having people just dial their phones?That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say \"Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!\"Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.Whether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that's got an iPhone application and a State Department that's asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter.Judging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let's hope they won't have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.@highlightAnil Dash says Internet was designed to endure disasters, free up communication@highlightDash: If Web's goal is decentralization, why was Twitter crash so disabling for many?@highlightDash reminds us that social networks come and go; remember when AOL ruled?@highlightWeb users should take charge of their own communication efforts, Dash urges", "category": "large"}

This unspoilt place, with no traces of modernity, struck me like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus,\" he says.Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman, has since made it his life's mission to rescue such crumbling villages by turning them into high-end resorts that blend in with their surroundings.Sextantio (Via Principe Umberto, Santo Stefano di Sessanio; +39 0862 899112) in Santo Stefano is one of several so-called \"diffuse hotels\" that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof.Instead, Sextantio's 29 rooms, spa, wine bar, restaurant and reception lie scattered in separate buildings formerly used as barns, stables, pigsties, wine cellars and farmers' or shepherds' lodgings.Wood and stone cottages have been restyled as suites, the village dungeons serve as a wedding room and a former witch's lair now hosts business meetings.The hotel even makes use of a medieval brothel.Santo Stefano di Sessanio is a maze of cobbled streets, steep stone stairs, arches, vaults, gargoyles, hidden grottoes, frescoed loggias and crumbling walls covered in ivy.There are also ruins -- the remains of the houses collapsed during the 2009 earthquake that rocked nearby L'Aquila.Slaughtered pigKihlgren gives me the grand tour, describing his early days trying to acquire property in the hamlet -- leading to surreal situations for both him and the villagers.\"When I knocked at people's doors offering to buy their dwellings, they thought I was crazy,\" he says.\"Once a local slaughtered a pig right in front of my eyes with Bach playing in the background.\"Today the village may be marginally less rustic, but Sextantio's charm lies in its sympathetic use of historic structures.At the reception, housed in a former donkey stable at the hamlet's entrance where nativity scenes are staged at Christmas, the concierge hands me the biggest and heaviest room key I've ever encountered: 30 centimeters of pure iron.\"That way you'll never lose it,\" she says.A path leads to my room -- La Bianca -- one of the closest cottages to the reception (the farthest one lies 200 meters away).I open the squeaky bolt of a heavy wooden door and enter a snug, warm room filled with the scent of embers and orange peel -- a perfume created by the hotel to evoke a typical hearth scent.Old furniture, including a spinning wheel and museum pieces, are juxtaposed with modern sculptures and sleek, luxurious bathroom facilities.Showering in the elegant white resin tub is an experience. Rinsing involves using a pitcher to collect running water from a low tap, a throwback to the past.There's no television, phone or minibar, but it's not totally offline.There's a powerful Wi-Fi signal throughout the buildings.Bird's nestLying back on my wrought iron king size bed, I spot an old bird's nest among the wood ceiling beams.\"This is what I call 'authentic' Italy,\" says Kihlgren. \"I wanted to restyle the buildings as we found them and bring back to life the so-called secondary human heritage: that of poor, outcast communities who for centuries stood as Italy's shame.\"That's why I kept the cracks in the walls and the fireplace hearth soot: these are layers of history.\"Sextantio is the opposite of colonialist tourism. Clients here want to discover the village identity and mingle with locals.\"Outside, in the center of the hamlet, silence rules. No cars are allowed.Just 50 residents still live here and, walking around, I come across elderly women sitting on doorsteps and art restorers at work.Occasionally a passerby looks at me shyly, but greets me with a hello.\"Even when the hotel is fully booked you'll feel on your own,\" says Annunziata Taraschi, who has an unusual job as Sextantio's anthropologist, collecting the village's oral tradition and lost customs.While that might be great for guests, locals aren't so sure.\"It's one thing coming here as a visitor, and another living here\" says Dina Rusciolelli, owner of La Bettola di Geppetto, the village tavern.\"After a while you can go nuts.\"There are no complaints about the food though -- a mix of gourmet and traditional.Sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the Cantinone, a large dining room 50 meters from reception, Franco Cannioli serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats, lentil soup, pecorino cheese, pears and nuts.Bloodsucking witchesThere's a glass of Montepulciano di Abruzzo red wine on the table.Evening meals are taken in La Locanda Sotto gli Archi, the hotel's grotto restaurant located on the other side of the hamlet where chef Simone Iezzi serves a daily changing menu that includes signature dishes like ricotta cheese ravioli, pork chops and fried breaded porcini mushrooms.After an afternoon nap, I'm greeted in the hotel's tea room and craft shop by Giovanna Fiorenzi, who sits at an old spinning frame making wool carpets, bed covers and giving weaving lessons to guests.She also spins a few old tales, telling me about spirits haunting the woods and witches who suck the blood of crying babies.She serves licorice and artichoke herbal tea alongside traditional Ferratelle waffles.She also makes Genziana, a sweet and sour alcoholic drink made from Gentian roots.There's a crystal bottle of Genziana and a crackling fire waiting for me when I get back to my room in evening.The next morning I'm woken by birdsong and light filtering through small, wooden-framed windows.Breakfast is a buffet table laden with homemade yogurt, pies, ricotta cheese and a ham leg over in the restaurant.It's fine to wander over there before getting ready for the day to savor one of the great treats of these hamlet hotels.How many other hotels offer guest the chance to stroll outside through a mountain village, taking in great views and fresh air, while wearing pajamas?Other 'diffuse' hotelsScicli Albergo Diffuso sits among the ruins of a temple and has Baroque dwellings spread across a UNESCO-listed historical center.

Once upon a time, the iconic lead singer of Led Zeppelin and the golden girl of bluegrass would never have been mentioned in the same sentence.Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's \"Raising Sand\" was an unlikely collaboration that won five Grammys.But since they won five Grammy awards -- including album of the year for their surprising collaboration, \"Raising Sand\" -- their names have been inextricably linked: RobertPlantandAlisonKrauss.If they were 20 years old and ran in Hollywood circles, tabloids might be calling them Robekrauss or Aliplant.Plant, however, is 60 -- in fantastic shape, and with a full head of the golden ringlets that became his trademark during the 1970s.At 37, Krauss is elegant and ethereal. And while both are dead serious when talking about their craft, the rest of the time, they're like two silly junior high kids -- he, the charming prankster with a secret crush, and she, the beautiful prom queen who pretends not to be amused.Clearly, they're both having the time of their lives, and are excited about their current musical journey -- which pushes each out of their respective comfort zones and into new territory. Now, he's a little bit country and she's a little bit rock 'n' roll.  Watch Plant and Krauss rib each other \u00bbI compliment Krauss on her hair as a stylist touches her up. \"It's not mine,\" she whispers.Two feet away, Plant clears his throat loudly and points to his own golden locks. \"Why, your hair looks lovely, too, Robert,\" I say.\"Well, you know who I am,\" he replies.We are in Coldplay's vacated dressing room, two nights before Plant and Krauss swept the evening at the 51st annual Grammy Awards. This is an excerpt from our conversation in the basement of Staples Center in Los Angeles the night of their rehearsal.CNN: First of all, this is the screwiest collaboration I had ever heard of. How did this happen?Robert Plant: It's just sheer luck, really. I never sang with anybody before, you know -- only once ever in my life, on \"Led Zep IV\" with Sandy Denny [the late English folk singer, in 1971]. So this is a whole new thing. I've also been coming to the United States for 40 years -- you wouldn't believe it looking at me -- and I've never worked with Americans! This is all brand new for me.Alison Krauss: Were we both nervous? We both were. We thought, \"What are we going to do in there?\" We went into the studio originally saying, \"We'll give it three days and see what it's like.\"Plant: Alison's reputation is 24 karat, and I'm an old rock 'n' roll singer. Even the band was kind of going, \"Oh wow, how is this going to work?\" It was great when we kicked in together, and I could just feel the room -- I don't want to say it, but the room lifted!CNN: Musically, you're polar opposites. How did you blend your different perspectives?Plant: As we got started, it was Alison's world. She knew how she wanted to proceed, and we exchanged a lot of ideas musically. And then we both agreed that because we both produced records ourselves, that we needed an intermediary to guide -- somebody to separate us, or to make the journey more clear. And Alison knew T Bone Burnett from \"O Brother, Where Art Thou,\" and he kindly enlisted for the gig, and he brought a lot of great songs to the show.CNN: You challenged one another to sing in different ways than you're used to.Plant: When she goes up for these wailing notes on stage, that's where I want her to go with this new project -- occasionally visit these places where she lets rip, and just lets it really come out.Krauss (melodramatically): It's just reckless abandon! It's just crazy!Plant: I don't know why I'm being so serious. She just kicks ass and nobody knew it!CNN: Now this is all making sense. With Alison, it's letting go, and with you, Robert, it's kind of containing things.Plant: I'm being bullied, basically. Pushed around.CNN: But you like it. Admit it, you love it.Plant: Oh, I do! I haven't even gotten off to being bullied enough yet.CNN: Did you have this much fun working with Zeppelin?Plant: I can't remember. Honestly, I haven't got a clue. I was a totally different guy then. It was 28 years ago. I didn't look as good as I do now, and I didn't share the couch with another Leo.CNN: Alison, did you listen to Led Zeppelin growing up?Krauss: We all have, yeah. (Plant is shaking his head and mouthing the word \"No.\") My brother was and is such a huge fan of the band, and I remember growing up and he would be in his bedroom yelling about the records and how great they were.CNN: Robert, were you familiar with Alison's work?Plant: Yeah, to some degree, but not as intensely as I became. And also, I didn't understand the history of where Alison's from [bluegrass], and has been since she was a child. In fact, both of us can sit there talking about music, and neither of us can recognize the artists we're referring to. It's amazing. I mean, all the rock 'n' roll, and black Mississippi and Chicago stuff that I go raving on about, she's going, \"Hmm.\"Krauss: I didn't grow up on that, yeah.CNN: Has he made you listen to his music collection?Plant: We share.Krauss: I bring bluegrass. It's the same people. Same blue-collar people. Just one was south of the Delta, and one was Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina. So we've got lots in common -- but it's the presentation and the whole musicality of it that's different.CNN: Your collaboration has worked out so well that you're back in the studio in Nashville, working on a second album together.Plant: We'd like to keep it going.CNN: Do you think there's going to be an album No. 3, and an album No. 4?Plant: I'd have to move to Nashville, wouldn't I?CNN: Or she moves to England.Plant (to Krauss): Could you stand the climate?Krauss: I'll get a heating pad.Plant: And a season ticket for Wolverhampton Wanderers football club. That's important.CNN: You gained a lot of fans with this project, but there are those Led Zeppelin diehards who've been holding their breath for a reunion tour -- especially since you reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert at Wembley in 2007.Plant: Well, we had a really good night, and we had great rehearsals, and it was very emotional -- and if you like, quite elevating. But it was the right thing to do to do it that way. There's no bandwagon. We've already been around the world, and did what we did when we were young men.CNN: That sounds like a man who's looking forward, and not back.Plant: Only last week, I was being grilled again by Alison to get into shape and get it right. And that's fantastic! I really want that. I don't want to go around, everybody thinking, \"That's what he did.\" Because this is what I do, and every day, it should be more interesting.CNN: And in the meantime, you've been recognized by the Grammys.Plant: We've already won by doing this. We've brought our gifts, and we've shared them, and the whole surrounding musically is so beautiful, that that's our reward. The fact that it worked. The fact that it wasn't some embarrassing moment of two people trying something out, and saying goodbye, and then meeting at a party years later and saying, \"Oh, Christ, there's Alison Krauss!

{"question_id": 66, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nA 20-year dispute between a Nevada rancher and federal rangers over illegal cattle grazing erupted into an Old West-style showdown on the open range this week, even prompting self-proclaimed members of militia groups from across the country to join the rancher in fighting what they say is U.S. \"tyranny.\"What began as a legal fight between longtime rancher Cliven Bundy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has escalated as Bundy kept his cattle on the federal land, and the government has responded by beginning roundups of the livestock.A confrontation teetered on violence Wednesday when Bundy family members and dozens of supporters angrily confronted a group of rangers holding Tasers and barking dogs on leashes near Bunkerville, about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas.Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted.Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser.In the end, the rangers got into their white SUVs and drove away, a YouTube video of the incident showed.\"Get out of our state!\" the cheering protesters yelled at the rangers as they departed in several vehicles. \"BLM go away! BLM go away!\" they added, referring to the Bureau of Land Management.The entire incident is now under investigation, Amy Lueders, the bureau's director in Nevada, said Thursday.To some, the 67-year-old Bundy is a hero who hails from a long family of ranchers stretching back to the Wild West.To environmentalists and the feds, however, he's an outlaw of sorts who owes U.S. taxpayers more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees.The U.S. government is rounding up Bundy's cattle that it says have been grazing illegally on public lands in Clark County for more than 20 years, according to the land-management bureau and the National Park Service.Between Saturday and Wednesday, contracted wranglers impounded a total of 352 cattle, federal officials said. Bundy says he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials are planning to confiscate for illegal grazing, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Bundy told the newspaper that each head of his livestock is worth about $1,000.Since the roundups began, protesters have been confined to two areas to publicly declare their grievances, but the peaceful protests in recent days \"have crossed into illegal activity, including blocking vehicles associated with the (roundup), impeding cattle movement, and making direct and overt threats to government employees,\" the two federal agencies said in a statement.On Wednesday, a bureau truck driven by a civilian employee assisting in the roundup \"was struck by a protester on an ATV and the truck's exit from the area was blocked by a group of individuals who gathered around the vehicle,\" the agencies' statement said.In the scuffle with protesters, a police dog was kicked, and officers protecting the civilian driver were threatened and assaulted, the two agencies' statement said. \"After multiple requests and ample verbal warnings, law enforcement officers deployed Tasers on a protestor,\" the statement said.The profanity-laced tussle was captured on a video posted on YouTube. A group that said it posted the video didn't respond to requests for comment.In the video, protesters demanded to know why a backhoe and a dump truck were being used in the roundup -- and whether any livestock were killed. On Thursday, Lueders said the heavy equipment was used for field restoration.\"No BLM! No BLM!\" the protesters chanted to rangers in the middle of a two-lane rural highway.What sounds likes zapping Tasers can be heard in the video.In the wake of the publicized protests, members of various militia groups have been traveling from Virginia, Texas, Montana, Idaho and Wisconsin and arriving at the protest site and Bundy's ranch to support the family, said Stephen L. Dean, 45, of Utah, a member of one such group called the Peoples United Mobile Armed Services.\"It's tyranny in government,\" Dean said when asked what brought him to Nevada.And, he added, \"stealing people's cattle.\"One banner at the protest side stated: \"Has the West been won? Or has the fight just begun!\"In removing Bundy's livestock from public lands, the park service and land bureau are carrying out two U.S. District Court orders from two different judges.\"Cattle have been grazing in trespass on public lands in Southern Nevada for more than two decades,\" the National Park Service said. \"The BLM and NPS have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially. Impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is an option of last resort.\"Added the BLM: \"Mr. Bundy has also failed to comply with multiple court orders to remove his cattle from the federal lands and to end the illegal trespass.\"The bureau does allow grazing on federal lands -- it administers 18,000 grazing permits and leases on 157 million acres across the country, the agency said.Bundy's dispute with the government began about 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortoise, KLAS reported.Bundy refused to abide by the changes and stopped paying his grazing fees to the federal bureau, which he contends is infringing on state rights. His family has been ranching since the 1800s, before the U.S. Department of Interior was created and endangered species became a federal issue, he said in an interview with KLAS.\"My forefathers have been up and down the Virgin Valley ever since 1877. All these rights I claim have been created through pre-emptive rights and beneficial use of the forage and the water. I have been here longer. My rights are before the BLM even existed,\" Bundy told the station.\"With all these rangers and all this force that is out here, they are only after one man right now. They are after Cliven Bundy. Whether they want to incarcerate me or whether they want to shoot me in the back, they are after me. But that is not all that is at stake here. Your liberty and freedom is at stake,\" he continued.And Bundy sees it as a state issue.\"The federal government has seized Nevada's sovereignty ... they have seized Nevada's laws and our public land. We have no access to our public land and that is only a little bit of it,\" he said.This week, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval told the bureau of residents' criticism of the roundup.What Sandoval said he found \"most disturbing\" was the BLM's use of a \"First Amendment area\" that confined protesters to a designated area.Such an area \"tramples upon Nevadans' fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution,\" Sandoval said. \"No cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans.\"In response, federal officials are allowing the protesters to gather on public lands as long as they don't impede the roundup, said Lueders, the BLM's director in Nevada.Bundy is digging in for a long fight.\"I've been fighting this for a number of years. It's not about my cows, I'll tell you that much,\" he said at a town meeting on Wednesday night. \"It's about freedom and liberty and our Constitution ... and above all it's about our policing power. Who has policing power today?\"With the growing controversy, it was uncertain Thursday how long the cattle roundup will now last. At Wednesday night's meeting, residents gave Bundy a standing ovation when he publicly spoke.\"I love you people. And I love this land, and I love freedom and liberty,\" Bundy told the crowd. \"I know without doubt that our Constitution didn't provide for anything like the federal government owning this land, and so when I pay my grazing fees -- if I owe any grazing fees -- I will sure pay it to the right landlord, and that will be to Clark County, Nevada.\"@highlightFeds: Cliven Bundy's livestock has been illegally grazing on U.S. lands for 20 years@highlightBundy says his family's cattle has grazed on the land since the 1800s@highlightAfter winning in court, U.S. officials begin a roundup of his 500 cattle@highlightA YouTube video shows family and supporters in a heated face-off with rangers", "category": "large"}

Several top military leaders and opposition Republicans are pressing Obama to act quickly to increase the present 68,000-troop level by as many as 40,000.\"There's no doubt that, particularly on funding, it's not going to happen until Congress signs off,\" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday. \"They're an important part of this, and the president wants to hear from them.\"In March, Obama announced a plan to send more than 20,000 additional troops to the country to provide security for a national election. That move followed what Obama and others called years of inadequate resources in Afghanistan because of the Bush administration's focus on Iraq.The Obama strategy was based on a counterinsurgency mission intended to defeat terrorists based in Afghanistan while winning local support and helping with development.Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who took over four months ago as the top U.S. commander in the country, has submitted an assessment in which, sources have told CNN, he says he needs additional forces to carry out the counterinsurgency strategy successfully. Otherwise, McChrystal reportedly warns, the mission could fail, bringing a return of power to the Taliban.\"We need to reverse the current trends, and time does matter,\" McChrystal said last week in a speech in London, England. \"Waiting does not prolong a favorable outcome. This effort will not remain winnable indefinitely.\"U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, appeared to push back Monday against those who are loudly urging a rapid troop increase. It's \"important that we get it right,\" he told a U.S. Army audience.Gates said that it's also \"important that all of us ... provide the best advice to the president candidly but privately.\"Gen. George Casey, chief of staff of the Army, echoed Gates' view, telling reporters that he would be sharing his views \"in private\" and that they'd be \"the second to know.\"Obama has yet to respond to McChrystal's report, prompting opponents to accuse him of indecisiveness and playing politics that puts U.S. soldiers on the ground at risk.  Watch more on the debate over the best way forward \u00bbNational Security Adviser James Jones Jr. on Sunday cited three developments since March that have led the White House to reconsider its overall Afghanistan strategy:\u2022 Questions about the legitimacy of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's election victory. \u2022 McChrystal's conclusion that the Taliban is stronger than previously thought. \u2022 Neighboring Pakistan's improved efforts to change the overall dynamic of the border region.\"The key in Afghanistan is to have a triad of things happen simultaneously,\" Jones said on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" listing improved security, economic development and \"good governance and the rule of law.\"Jones said Karzai's government \"is going to have to pitch in and do much better\" than it has to improve the governance situation after the elections, widely considered as tainted by vote fraud in some areas.Some in Obama's inner circle, including Vice President Joe Biden, are advocating a counterterrorism approach that focuses on combating al Qaeda through the use of unmanned drones and special forces without involving additional troops.Others, especially McChrystal, are strongly advocating the broader counterinsurgency approach, which requires a much larger U.S. military footprint in the country.  See who has Obama's ear on Afghanistan \u00bbSen.

According to supermarket tracking services, Portland leads the United States in percentage of craft beer sales with nearly 40% of beer purchases being craft beer.2. Oregon breweries brewed 53% of all the draft beer served in the state.3. We keep finding new places to serve beer, such as growler-fill stations, which have opened in major grocery stores, as stand-alone establishments and in a Southeast Portland mini-mart that anywhere else would sell fried chicken and half-racks of Milwaukee's Best.4. Speaking of growlers (large, re-fillable bottles that allow you to take large amounts of freshly tapped beer to go), the Portland-designed, Steampunk-styled uKeg keeps beer cold and carbonated and people love the idea: Growlerwerks LLC hoped to raise $75,000 in its Kickstarter campaign and so far nearly 5,000 people have donated $665,000 -- with about three weeks to go.5. It's hard to imagine the critical mass of more than 60 brewing establishments in a town.In close-in Southeast Portland, a dozen breweries and brewpubs populate just a few square blocks.Toss in pubs such as the Basement, Apex, White Owl Social Club, Blitz and the BeerMongers, and you have a walking beer tour that could fill a couple of days.6. If you don't want to walk, there are several beer-tour companies including Brewvana beer bus tours (with Japanese-language tours, as well) and the u-pedal aerobics of Pedalounge, which is a sort of 12-person pedal-powered bar with stools and an awning, except you can't drink on the road.7. We have the biggest outdoor beer party on the continent, July's Oregon Brewers Festival, which attracts more than 85,000 people a year -- many of whom are out-of-state or international beer tourists -- to its five-day run at Tom McCall Waterfront Park.8. Missed the OBF? No problem.Beer festivals happen year' round in Portland, such as December's Holiday Ale Festival, when thousands of big-beer fans drink can't-find-'em-anywhere-else winter beers in large, heated tents in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square.It's a rare day in Beervana without a beer event, thanks to great bottle shops such as Belmont Station, BeerMongers, By The Bottle, Imperial Bottle Shop and Taproom and others that organize a couple hundred beer releases, meet-the-brewer events, tap takeovers and the like every year.There are also brewers dinners, beer tastings and Roscoe's monthly beer summits.Nobody's done an official festival count, but Portland hosts more than a hundred a year, including specialized events such as an organic beer festival, a fruit beer festival, Peche Fest (only peach beers and ciders on tap) and Biketobeer Fest.9. Portland is the site of the national 2015 Craft Brewers Conference. Can thousands of brewers and industry types be wrong?10. Portland created the fresh-hop beer category, when brewers trek to local hop farms for just-picked hops and make special beers.Oregon celebrates its hop bounty with several fresh-hop beer festivals every fall, and pubs such as the Lucky Labrador Brewing Company hold hop-picking parties harvesting backyard hop plants.11. Portland has a dedicated gluten-free brewery, Ground Breaker, where no barley malt nor wheat shall ever tread.They brew a variety of G-F beers with roasted chestnuts and the like.Nationally distributed Omission is also brewed in Portland, with traditional ingredients and a special process to remove gluten.12. Anything qualifies as an excuse to pour special beers: recently opened Baerlic Brewing celebrated the life of Evel Knievel one night and Ecliptic Brewing, owned by longtime Oregon brewer (and avid astronomer) John Harris, opened its first-anniversary week with an eclipse-viewing party on an overcast Thursday.

His mother is one of nine children, many of whom still live in the Palestinian territory.\"Every missile hits close to home, pardon the pun,\" he said. \"It's the worst reality television you'd ever want to watch.\"For example, when the past week's violence between Israel and Hamas' military wing in Gaza killed a family of 10 in Gaza, Durrah learned that he was distantly related to them. The family was an in-law of a cousin, he said.Will cease-fire last?\"Gaza is very much the type of place where everybody is connected,\" said Durrah, 30.Wednesday's cease-fire between Israel and Hamas has provided some comfort, until the smoke clears and the wreckage can be assessed in Gaza, Durrah said.\"A cease-fire may bring a little bit of relief, but when the cease-fire is done, they return to the status quo -- minus their homes,\" Durrah said. \"They have to rebuild them without any means to do so, so it's going to be tough.\"How U.S. Jews view the conflictArab-Americans, Muslims and the Palestinian diaspora are focusing renewed energy and concern on Gaza, a sliver of land along the Mediterranean coast that is about twice the size of Washington and is populated by 1.6 million people, including 1.1 Palestinian refugees.\"Palestine is a central issue for most Arab-Americans,\" said Laila Mokhiber, spokeswoman for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\"Overall, Arab-Americans want to see an end to the siege on Gaza. Until that happens and until the Palestinians are able to exercise their basic human rights, we can't expect to see a lasting cease-fire or peace,\" Mokhiber said.Analysis: Conflict shifts balance of powerMany Arab-Americans say Gaza is under Israeli occupation. Durrah likened Gaza to \"a cage,\" walled-in and cut off to the outside world by Israel.Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza shortly after Hamas was elected to run the Gaza government in 2006.That blockade -- as well as Israel's military might, backed by the United States -- has created humanitarian concerns in Gaza, according to the Arab-American group. The West Bank is also part of the historical conflict between Israel and Palestinians.\"The occupation of both the West Bank and Gaza and the blockade against Gaza -- as long as that is a reality, you're going to see tensions between Palestinians and Israel,\" Mokhiber said. \"You have civilians against the fourth strongest military in the world. They're killing kids. They're killing civilians. It's not military against military.\"Durrah owns an event management business that operates fund-raisers for Palestine. He's also a comedian who does stand-up in Las Vegas and Manhattan. But the carnage between Hamas in Gaza and Israel is no laughing matter, and he doesn't engage in the endless arguments so common in the Mideast about who started what in a centuries-long history, he said.Timeline of the conflict\"What do you say about a place that has been occupied for more than 50 years,\" Durrah said. \"This is a situation where people were born in occupation and lived their entire lives in occupation and died in occupation. It's crazy to me.\"If you cage an animal long enough, eventually when you get close to that cage, they're going to hiss at you and they may even scratch,\" Durrah said.Durrah's family received a phone call Tuesday from relatives in Rimal, Gaza.\"They were literally telling my mother how glass shakes. They were just afraid. They don't know what tomorrow brings or what the next hour brings,\" Durrah said.Those perils are difficult for Durrah to imagine. It's hard on him, too.\"It's fear of going to sleep and getting a phone call or, worse, not getting any phone call and wondering -- having the feeling of whether no news is good news or not,\" Durrah said. \"Our issues are so small in comparison to what they're going to go through. We may not be able to sleep because of a cricket in the room, but they are trying to sleep through the soundtrack of blasts and missiles.\"This month's exchange of Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes has prompted pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel rallies throughout the United States.On Wednesday evening, the Congress of Arab American Organizations in Michigan, home to a large Arab diaspora, held a vigil in front of the Dearborn City Hall in support of the Palestinians, and more than 500 Palestinian-Americans, other Arab-Americans, Muslims and others attended the event, said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, a weekly bilingual newspaper in Dearborn, Michigan, who also organized the event.Gaza has \"been under Israeli siege for many years which makes it a large virtual prison,\" the group said in a statement. \"Just 43 kilometers (about 27 miles) long and 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) wide, most of its residents are Palestinian refugees who have lived in camps since 1948.\"The violence has prompted an outpouring of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, said Saleem Zaru, a Palestinian-American who is executive director of United Palestinian Appeal in Washington.In the past five days, the nongovernmental organization received between $40,000 and $50,000 in donations, which will help 550 families in Gaza who need food and shelter because of  the conflict, Zaru said.

I think we both have a lot in common -- we're both big sports fans and I think our relationship has evolved from there because we've played together quite a lot this year.\"It's been great for me to get to know him and maybe try and pick up a few things and learn from him too.\"McIlroy wins PGA Player of the YearBefore the rise of McIlroy, golf's undisputed No. 1 player this year, Woods' previous big rival was Phil Mickelson -- and their relationship was notoriously frosty.They snapped at each other via the media, and Woods' former caddy Steve Williams ramped up the tension with some choice remarks to the press and and fans from which even his employer had to hastily distance himself.Friendly enemiesBut Woods, now 36, seems much happier in competition with McIlroy despite the 23-year-old being poised to usurp him as Nike's biggest golf endorsement.\"We've battled each other a few times, but we have a lot in common,\" Woods said. \"Granted, there's an age difference but I had a huge age difference with my other good friend Mark O'Meara, but we had so much in common.\"I think our relationship will certainly grow over the years, but so too will our competitiveness -- I don't think that's going to change.\"Magical McIlroy reigns in DubaiHowever, while Woods is good friends with O'Meara, a man almost 20 years his senior, they were never really on-course rivals despite the older American's two major triumphs in 1998 -- a year of highs that he never repeated.But if Woods and McIlroy are to become truly great adversaries along the lines of Nicklaus-Tom Watson and Ben Hogan-Sam Snead then they can't afford to become too cosy, according to sports leadership expert Khoi Tu.\"At the extreme, the ability to defeat your opponent, to crush them, requires huge mental discipline,\" said Tu, whose book \"Superteams\" features the F1-dominating Ferrari/Schumacher era and the 2010 Ryder Cup-winning team captained by European golf icon Colin Montgomerie.\"As soon as you begin empathizing with your competitor, you may not have that killer instinct,\" Tu told CNN. \"Great sporting rivalries bring out the best in both players. Great sporting friendships is a great tactic for one and not the other.\"If Rory becomes a genuine rival as opposed to the rival of the moment, then I think Tiger will find it hard not to compete in every dimension possible.\"It's in his DNA, it's what makes him a great competitor. In many respects the best thing about it would be if they did become real rivals, if there was a sense of abrasion or friction -- a sense that sparks fly. It would do wonders for the sport.\"Woods, McIlroy 'too tired' for $7`M Chinese tournamentAs Nicklaus once said of Palmer: \"We are adversarial friends or friendly enemies. All our lives we've competed against each other. Arnold and I fight like the devil about stuff.\"Tennis stars Murray and Djokovic have been friends since childhood, but they have still maintained a ferocious on-court rivalry that this year has reached towards the heights of predecessors such as Federer-Nadal, Borg-McEnroe and Navratilova-Evert.Roger Federer at first struggled when Rafael Nadal ended his complete domination of the men's game, but the duo now publicly insist they are firm friends following years of epic clashes -- despite an apparent spat this year over the Spaniard's desire for changes to be made on the ATP Tour.\"Great shared experiences build great bonds between people,\" Tu says. \"That bond is different than friendship. It's a bond of respect.\"Bitter feudFor Woods and McIlroy there is every incentive to cast themselves as friends and rivals.Already they have been lured into playing a lucrative exhibition clash in one of golf's key markets, China, that led them to withdraw from a premier European Tour event in the same country later that week.\"They both just got huge paydays in China, they may be putting a slight front on that camaraderie,\" sports psychologist Dan Abrahams told CNN.\"In a sport like golf, having a spat with a rival isn't seen as being the right thing, whereas (in soccer) Alex Ferguson having a spat with (rival manager) Arsene Wenger, that seems to be quite normal.\"Abrahams argues some of McIlroy's older European peers such as Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke -- who have won only one major title between them -- may have suffered from their on-tour friendship.\"Speaking with a lot of golf coaches, that generation have been perhaps a bit too friendly with each other,\" said Abrahams.\"If you compare them with Nick Faldo, he was renowned for keeping himself quite isolated, which was a catalyst for his competitiveness. I think keeping your distance from competitors can be a useful thing.\"Faldo has questioned the apparent friendship of golf's two biggest names, but McIlroy played down the criticism.\"You're on tour long enough and you don't need enemies out there, you want to have friends,\" the Northern Irishman told CNN.\"Life on tour can get a bit lonely at times and you wanna have guys that you can go out for dinner with. You're seeing most of the guys each week and you've got to have someone to talk to. If that's what worked for Faldo then great, but I don't think it would work for me.\"Ferrari drops Vettel appeal planIn the high-octane world of Formula One, Alonso is known for his clashes with fellow drivers -- he left McLaren after only one season following a bitter feud with teammate Lewis Hamilton.However, this year the Spaniard has been much more respectful of Vettel, despite Ferrari's united front in downplaying the achievements of Red Bull's history-making triple world champion.Recalibrating sportRumors persist that the Italian marque wants to sign Vettel for the 2014 season, which would be an acid test for relations between the two drivers.\"When you get two No. 1 drivers together with no team rules, then the sparks can really fly,\" says Tu, who has worked with Ferrari and former F1 world champion Jackie Stewart.\"It's rare for them to be good mates. They may get along, they may trust and respect each other in a professional capacity, but hanging out is a different issue.\"Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who has now retired for a second time, was known for his win-at-all costs approach at Ferrari but such an attitude is becoming increasingly unacceptable for sports fans, says Tu.Contrast the feelgood factor of the London 2012 Olympics with the demonization of Lance Armstrong, who has refused to contest allegations of systematic doping during his time as cycling's tour de force.\"There is, at the moment, a very fine line that sport is treading -- this desire and ambition to win, but not to do so at all costs,\" says Tu.\"Someone like Schumacher, his desire to win would take him to the dark side. That type of willingness to do whatever it takes is a feature of champions. Unmoderated, it's pretty dangerous for the game.\"We've just been through a period of excess and egregious behavior from many corporates -- but equally sporting teams as well. The desire to win, and the merits and rewards of winning, maybe outweighed the joy of winning.\"I think sport is recalibrating. That's why the Olympics made everyone so happy.

At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did.\"In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting, which has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Barack Obama to call it a tragedy, and prompted a federal investigation.Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually.\"He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken,\" Robert Zimmerman said. \"He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete.\"Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation.The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts.A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car.The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video does not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head, but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face.\"The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all,\" said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. \"He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in any way, shape or form, someone whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone whose nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal.\"Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly.\"I believe that this video is the icing on the cake,\" she said. \"This is not the first part of the evidence that they have had. They have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses. This is in addition to what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested.\"The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store.Evolution of the hoodieZimmerman says he killed Martin in self defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community. Zimmerman has not been arrested, and authorities have said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of what happened.The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling, and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest.Spike Lee apologizes for retweet errorRobert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism.\"I never foresaw so much hate coming from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP. Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way,\" Robert Zimmerman told WOFL. \"But there's so much hate that I have never been involved in hate and George hasn't. It's really unbelievable.\"Robert Zimmerman said his son is not racist and race had nothing to do with the incident.\"He would do anything to help anybody at any time. He's colorblind when it comes to any race,\" Robert Zimmerman said.Tracy Martin, Trayvon Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son.In a recording of Zimmerman's call to police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur.Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur.Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman has said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag had been determined to contain marijuana residue.Benjamin Crump, Martin's parents' attorney, said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth.Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida.But as more and more information surfaces, the picture of what happened becomes more complicated.What the witnesses are sayingDespite the twists and turns in the case, Fulton, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case.\"I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,\" Fulton said. \"We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month.

{"question_id": 72, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nChuck Hagel was doomed even before he walked into the Pentagon.The Vietnam veteran with deep relationships on Capitol Hill shocked Washington by appearing unprepared and inarticulate before his former colleagues during a Senate confirmation hearing to become defense secretary. He never really recovered and, nearly two years later, seemed increasingly out of step with an administration facing new national security challenges everywhere from the Middle East to Ukraine.Hagel announced his intent to resign on Monday. He was pushed out by President Barack Obama, sources told CNN, but will stay in the job until a successor is named.His departure reflects Hagel's inability to adapt to rapidly changing developments around the world or master the politics of Washington. Hagel joined the administration at a time when Obama insisted that the nation was moving beyond a decade of war only to find himself grappling with the threat from ISIS, turmoil in Iraq and aggressive moves from Russia.In fact, there were signs that Hagel was becoming increasingly critical in private of Obama's Syria strategy, which is constrained by the President's insistence that U.S. ground troops must not be dragged into a vicious civil war.\"I have heard he has been a dead man walking for a while. He just didn't prove effective\" said a former Pentagon official familiar with the personal dynamics of the Obama administration's foreign policy team.Some Hagel defenders say he never really had a chance.\"He came into an almost impossible situation,\" said Lawrence Korb, a former senior defense official now with the Center for American Progress. \"He had a confirmation hearing that really weakened him and he inherited a budget that was impacted by a sequester.\"Several former officials said Hagel was undermined by an assumption that his Pentagon tenure would happen during a time of peace that would allow him to focus on streamlining the defense budget and ending combat in Afghanistan.\"What you saw instead were rolling problems with Syrian chemical weapons, the rise of ISIS, and troops returning to Iraq,\" said another former administration official.Meanwhile, The New York Times reported over the weekend that Obama authorized a more expansive mission for the military in Afghanistan in 2015.A third former senior administration official said that although Obama genuinely liked Hagel, with whom he toured Iraq and Afghanistan before becoming president, an impression took hold in the White House that the defense Secretary had not mastered his job.\"He was effective (at) dealing with management and budget issues, but not as a public face for policies and not as a forceful presence in internal policy debates,\" the official said.Former Col. Peter Mansoor, a CNN defense analyst, said Hagel was \"a loyal team player whose skill sets as a senator never fully translated into being Secretary of Defense.He added: \"Both sides came to that conclusion.\"Obama and Hagel put on a united front at a White House resignation announcement on Monday, with Obama pouring praise on his defense secretary, apparently to neuter speculation about a political split.A Pentagon spokesman insisted that Hagel wasn't fired.\"Both men agree that this is the right course of action,\" Rear Admiral John Kirby told Jake Tapper on CNN's The Lead. \"And the Secretary said it clearly today, he not only supports it but he's the one who initiated the conversation with the President.\"But in Obama's orbit, it was accepted a long time ago that the choice of Hagel -- based on his friendship with Obama, criticism of the Iraq war surge and his standing as a former GOP senator -- never clicked.Hagel also appears to have been the latest outsider who struggled to penetrate the national security clique around Obama, which, if anything, has further narrowed during the president's second term. Those closest to the president have embraced a foreign policy philosophy nourished by a belief in ending foreign wars, not starting new ones.National security intimates include adviser Susan Rice, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes.Last month, it emerged that Hagel wrote a blunt memo to Rice criticizing the administration's approach to Syria as insufficient, warning, \"we need to have a sharper view of what to do about the Assad regime,\" a senior defense official told CNN.He appeared to be tackling the paradoxes of U.S. strategy in Syria, where Washington is fighting to eliminate ISIS, a scenario which could benefit President Bashar Al-Assad, to whom the administration is implacably opposed.Hagel also found himself stuck in the middle of the tussle between the White House and top generals, not just on Syria, but over post war Iraq and Afghanistan, with top brass pushing for a more direct U.S. military role than the White House envisions.In Washington's foreign policy community, there are also whispers that Obama forged a closer professional relationship with Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, than Hagel.His experience contrasts with Secretary of State John Kerry, who is also not a member of the White House's inner circle. But he commandeered initiatives on Russia, the Middle East and Iran. And though Kerry's success has been limited, there aren't any suggests that he's lost the confidence of aides within his department or in the administration.Hagel's appointment was partly intended to build on close relationships he maintained on Capitol Hill after leaving the Senate in 2009. But even those ties failed to help bolster Hagel.Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain repeatedly challenged Hagel in the tense confirmation hearing over whether he still believed his 2007 statement that the Iraq war surge was the \"most dangerous foreign policy blunder\" since the Vietnam War. Before voting against his confirmation, McCain warned \"nothing in Senator Hagel's background indicates that he would effectively manage the Department of Defense.\"Opinion: Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needsIronically, now that he has quit, some of his prime antagonists have his back.McCain told News Talk 550 radio in Arizona Monday that Hagel was \"up to the job\" but was in his office last week and was \"very frustrated.\"He later suggested in a statement that Hagel's departure was because of internal administration disagreements over ISIS strategy.\"I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,\" said McCain. \"His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully.McCain added: \"Chuck's situation was no different.\"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said his confidence in Hagel had grown over the past year.\"To his credit, he was really willing to consider a more robust response (than the president) and he started saying that Syria had become a direct threat to the homeland,\" he said.Hagel had also shown signs of being increasingly out of sync with White House messaging. This summer, he called ISIS an \"imminent threat to every interest we have.\"  But the White House insisted there was no sign that ISIS could harm the homeland and that the point of Obama's decision to engage the radical Sunni group was to ensure that it would not pose a danger in the future.Hagel's comments also contrasted with Obama's aside to the New Yorker in January that current militant groups were like a junior varsity team compared to Al-Qaeda - a quote widely seen as referring to ISIS.His departure may be one of several signs that the White House has no intention of changing its approach to national security in Obama's final two years in the White House.In a recent episode, deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken was nominated for the number two job in the State Department, over Wendy Sherman, who sources said Kerry wanted for the job.While there have been whispers around Hagel for months, the sudden nature of Monday's announcement sparked surprise on Capitol Hill, where speculation is already turning to his replacement.Graham said two of the most talked about candidates \u2014 Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, the former Under Secretary of Defense for policy, and Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who served in the Army's 82nd Airborne \u2014 would both be \"excellent.\" Reed took his name out of consideration on Monday.One former official suggested that Sen. Carl Levin, the retiring head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would also be a safe pair of hands for Obama's last two years in office.Meanwhile, there are questions about whether the management change at the Pentagon will reshape U.S. policy toward ISIS much as Donald Rumsfeld's departure as defense secretary at a similar point during George W. Bush's second term, opened the way for the Iraq surge.\"Is this new pick going to double down on an insufficient response and a flawed strategy?\" Graham said in a telephone interview, \"or will this new pick signal a willingness by Obama to accept a more robust response?\"\"It's an opportunity surrounded by danger,\" Graham said.Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needs@highlightHagel never recovered from struggle at Senate confirmation hearing@highlightHe went to Pentagon to cut budgets but instead faced new wars@highlightSources question whether he ever mastered job", "category": "large"}

He was in a remote area of Chile, doing an episode of \"Scientific American Frontiers,\" and he developed an intestinal obstruction that came within hours of killing him. It was his good fortune that he survived the whole ordeal.Alan Alda rummages through his life in his new book, \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself.\"Some time later, after he'd returned to the United States and resumed his acting career, he started digging through his house for old speeches and memorabilia. Decades ago, the existentialist philosophers brooded about life's meaninglessness; Alda wanted to find some meaning.\"As a lot of people do who are given a second chance at life, I find myself thinking about things like this,\" he says in a phone interview from New York. \"I notice a lot of people who go through that have a few more questions than they had before about their lives.\"It's not like his life had been bad before he almost died. He'd earned lasting fame as Hawkeye Pierce on \"M*A*S*H,\" received a variety of awards and nominations (including Emmy wins and an Oscar nod) and established a long-lasting, happy marriage and family. But there's nothing like escaping death to concentrate the mind wonderfully (to paraphrase Samuel Johnson).So, in the spirit of the examined life, Alda has put his thoughts -- derived from commencement speeches, advice and life experiences -- into a book: \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\" (Random House).\"What is my life adding up to?\" Alda asks rhetorically. \"I want to feel satisfied that I'm spending the time well.\"  Slide show: Alda on some influences \u00bbIt may seem like an odd pursuit for a man with so many honors, but Alda took the quest seriously.One theme that comes up over and over again is fear: \"It's one of the ways I feel alive,\" Alda says. That's true for both his public speaking engagements and his acting roles, he adds. \"When you escape near disaster you feel great, so I set these little disasters up for myself.\"There was the first time he played Hawkeye, for example. \"I was standing, waiting for the word 'action' to come out of a building for the first shot of the show,\" he recalls. But he'd been rehearsing for days and was no closer to getting a handle on the character.In the end, he trusted his instincts. \"I just took a leap into it. ... Sometimes those leaps are the most valuable way to do it.\"Alda doesn't diminish the impact of others. He pays tribute to a number of people in the book, from his father -- a well-known stage actor -- to such figures as actor Ossie Davis, scientist Richard Feynman (whom Alda portrayed on stage) and manager Martin Bregman.One Alda story, about actor Bert Convy, is revealing in a number of ways. To many, Convy -- if remembered at all -- is thought of (often derisively) as a game show host (\"Tattletales\") or '70s TV guest star. But Convy was also a fine stage actor -- he starred in the original \"Fiddler on the Roof\" on Broadway -- and, Alda remembers, showed courage during the violence of the 1968 Democratic convention in helping free some demonstrators.\"He was an unlikely hero of mine, because he really risked a lot one night in Chicago,\" Alda says. \"He saved some people from possibly getting badly hurt, getting them out of jail.\"And Convy, like some of Alda's \"M*A*S*H\" colleagues, is also an illustration of how performers get pigeonholed, a subject Alda has considered deeply. \"That's what usually happens when you get well-known in one part ... which is why it really is fair for actors to get paid a lot of money on television, because it could be the last time you'll see them. That one job for five or six years could turn out to be what their whole career is.\"There are also the pitfalls of celebrity itself, the blurring of boundaries between public roles and private life. Alda's been beseeched by troubled people, asked to give talks at medical schools and been stared at in restaurants. The attention, he admits, can be disconcerting.\"People were always curious about actors,\" he says. \"But now it's much more true. ... I think that's partly because the need to sell papers and keep profits up have devalued things a little bit.\"He tries to use his fame to his advantage. When talking to a group of budding doctors, he told them that just because he played a doctor on television didn't mean he knew something about medicine -- but he did know something about being a patient. And he's used his interest in science to encourage others, primarily through hosting \"Scientific American Frontiers.\"He loves science's give and take -- its determination to not take hypotheses at face value -- and scientists' pursuit of facts. He says he hopes others are similarly inspired.\"All of us depend on people being pretty rigorous about the way they see reality, and if we knew a little bit more about the way [scientists] work, I think we'd be able to support them in some of the things they do that will benefit us,\" he says.So, for all of his own rigor, did Alda come to any conclusions about the meaning of his life?He pauses.\"I think I come to some odd conclusions that sort of bring me back to where I was in the beginning,\" he says. He believes there's more to that existential interpretation: \"I think that what they were constantly saying was that life is meaningless, except for the meaning you bring to it by the choices you make and the things you do.\"With that, Alda wraps up the interview. He has an appointment, he says in passing: His granddaughter has some work on display in a photography exhibit, and he doesn't want to miss it.And that, he doesn't need to say, means the world.

Nor have there been any confirmed incidents of classified information being lost or sent to an outside source. But the virus has resisted multiple efforts to remove it from Creech's computers, network security specialists say. And the infection underscores the ongoing security risks in what has become the U.S. military's most important weapons system.\"We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,\" says a source familiar with the network infection, one of three that told Danger Room about the virus. \"We think it's benign. But we just don't know.\"Military network security specialists aren't sure whether the virus and its so-called \"keylogger\" payload were introduced intentionally or by accident; it may be a common piece of malware that just happened to make its way into these sensitive networks. The specialists don't know exactly how far the virus has spread. But they're sure that the infection has hit both classified and unclassified machines at Creech. That raises the possibility, at least, that secret data may have been captured by the keylogger, and then transmitted over the public internet to someone outside the military chain of command.Drones have become America's tool of choice in both its conventional and shadow wars, allowing U.S. forces to attack targets and spy on its foes without risking American lives. Since President Obama assumed office, a fleet of approximately 30 CIA-directed drones have hit targets in Pakistan more than 230 times; all told, these drones have killed more than 2,000 suspected militants and civilians, according to the Washington Post. More than 150 additional Predator and Reaper drones, under U.S. Air Force control, watch over the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. American military drones struck 92 times in Libya between mid-April and late August. And late last month, an American drone killed top terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki -- part of an escalating unmanned air assault in the Horn of Africa and southern Arabian peninsula.But despite their widespread use, the drone systems are known to have security flaws. Many Reapers and Predators don't encrypt the video they transmit to American troops on the ground. In the summer of 2009, U.S. forces discovered \"days and days and hours and hours\" of the drone footage on the laptops of Iraqi insurgents. A $26 piece of software allowed the militants to capture the video.The lion's share of U.S. drone missions are flown by Air Force pilots stationed at Creech, a tiny outpost in the barren Nevada desert, 20 miles north of a state prison and adjacent to a one-story casino. In a nondescript building, down a largely unmarked hallway, is a series of rooms, each with a rack of servers and a \"ground control station,\" or GCS. There, a drone pilot and a sensor operator sit in their flight suits in front of a series of screens. In the pilot's hand is the joystick, guiding the drone as it soars above Afghanistan, Iraq, or some other battlefield.Some of the GCSs are classified secret, and used for conventional warzone surveillance duty. The GCSs handling more exotic operations are top secret. None of the remote cockpits are supposed to be connected to the public internet. Which means they are supposed to be largely immune to viruses and other network security threats.But time and time again, the so-called \"air gaps\" between classified and public networks have been bridged, largely through the use of discs and removable drives. In late 2008, for example, the drives helped introduce the agent.btz worm to hundreds of thousands of Defense Department computers. The Pentagon is still disinfecting machines, three years later.Use of the drives is now severely restricted throughout the military. But the base at Creech was one of the exceptions, until the virus hit. Predator and Reaper crews use removable hard drives to load map updates and transport mission videos from one computer to another. The virus is believed to have spread through these removable drives. Drone units at other Air Force bases worldwide have now been ordered to stop their use.In the meantime, technicians at Creech are trying to get the virus off the GCS machines. It has not been easy. At first, they followed removal instructions posted on the website of the Kaspersky security firm. \"But the virus kept coming back,\" a source familiar with the infection says. Eventually, the technicians had to use a software tool called BCWipe to completely erase the GCS' internal hard drives. \"That meant rebuilding them from scratch\" -- a time-consuming effort.The Air Force declined to comment directly on the virus. \"We generally do not discuss specific vulnerabilities, threats, or responses to our computer networks, since that helps people looking to exploit or attack our systems to refine their approach,\" says Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, a spokesman for Air Combat Command, which oversees the drones and all other Air Force tactical aircraft. \"We invest a lot in protecting and monitoring our systems to counter threats and ensure security, which includes a comprehensive response to viruses, worms, and other malware we discover.\"However, insiders say that senior officers at Creech are being briefed daily on the virus.\"It's getting a lot of attention,\" the source says. \"But no one's panicking.

But this week, he has catapulted himself to national sainthood, winning Australia's second gold medal, this one in sailing.Australia has been in distress since the London Olympics began, watching a parlous performance in the pool where it usually performs exceedingly well. But there has been no Beijing haul of gold for the country's swimmers in London; just one gold in the women's 4 x 100 freestyle relay event, and nothing for the individual swims.iReport: What's your Olympic story?As a result, this sporting nation has been thrown into an identity crisis of sorts, played out in public as a tussle over what it means to be Australian. There are those who argue a poor gold medal tally is an appalling reflection of Australia's sporting prowess and an even worse for its self-esteem, playing out as it has on the international stage.Worse still, at number 19 in the gold medals table, it lags painfully behind Great Britain whose sporting achievements Australia likes to think it has and can always trump. And, for many Australians, the distinct possibility that New Zealand might walk away from this Olympic Games with more medals would be too much to bear.Read more: Pendleton tops golden night for Team GBAnd there's the more sober view that sees getting to the Olympics at all -- let alone winning lots of silver -- as an achievement. In this camp, being gracious losers is as important as being great winners. And that Australia's great hope, James Magnussen missed gold in the 100 meters freestyle by 1/100th of a second is to be worn as a badge of honor: we were that good.So furious has the public flogging of Australia's performance been, that long jumper Mitchell Watt who walked away with a silver medal for his efforts, gave the media a blast.\"I think people need to start understanding that it is not easy to win an Olympic gold medal and there is absolutely nothing wrong with a silver medal,\" said Watt.The problem, as Watt sees it, is that the media views silver and bronze as disappointing results.\"The team is happy, the coach is happy. I got thousands of messages [from] back home that they are happy. The only people that are not happy are you guys. So you need to wake up,\" he admonished.Still the critics are not silenced. As Slingsby won gold for the Laser class single-handed dinghies sailing event and Australia looked guaranteed to win another gold on the water, the headlines have been kinder but carry barely disguised missives of shame.Read more: Numbers behind 2012 Olympics\"Sailors come to Australia's Olympic rescue\" blared SBS online. \"Between them the sailors could spare the blushes of an Australian contingent that has been performing solidly without being able to convert seconds and thirds into Olympic titles.\"And there was this from Yahoo!7Sport: \"Pearson defends Australia's medal haul,\" in which hurdler Sally Pearson echoed Mitchell Watt's frustration with local disappointment.Across the Tasman, there was the anticipated barb: \"Australia back to its old self with gold\".The near empty satchel of gold has inspired a review of Australia's swimming performance. Ordered by Swimming Australia, at its head will be former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill. The aim will be to come up with a formula to prevent another national humiliation at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in two years time. But more than this, the aim will be to find out what went wrong in London.Was it team disunity? Or too much pre-event tweeting? Maybe the work ethic of the current crop isn't what it should be? Are the best of Australia's swimming coaches being lured by big dollars to train Chinese nationals? And a seemingly ridiculous question: should bearded swimmers be compelled to shave? Could it have been Magnusson's beard that ended his run for gold? It is all open to investigation, though Suzie O'Neill says there'll be no witch-hunt.In a nation accustomed to winning in sport, expectations are invariably high. Rarely is the concomitant pressure on competitors taken into account.As U.S. Open winner Sam Stosur has found, the weight of great expectation on your shoulders, is a viscerally grueling pressure. Bundled out in the first round at the 2012 Australian Open, before an audience expecting her to win after her New York triumph, took its toll.\"For sure it affects you physically, that's probably the easiest sign for the outside people to see,\" she told a media conference after her loss. \"I think it is easy to see that you tighten up, your shoulders do get tight, you don't hit through the ball.\"Young James Magnusson, head buried in hands as he digested his loss, put it this way: \"You come to the realization that I would've preferred a different colored medal but the funny thing is that all I wanted to do after the race was see my parents.''You start to get a realization of what is important. Everything's come so easy for me early in my career and I've taken it for granted,\" he said.The President of the Australian Olympic Committee John Coates believes the problem is not one of high expectations. That comes with the turf in elite sports.For Coates, the London problem might be eradicated in the future by reintroducing compulsory school sports. Though he warned last November that not enough money was flowing to the state-administered sports institutes to ensure the expected 45 medal haul in London, Coates doesn't think funding is an issue in Australian swimming.\"I think there is enough money in the system, they're just not necessarily spending it wisely,\" he told local media. The highest ranked Australian on the International Olympic Committee Kevin Gosper begs to differ. Money, he says, is the difference between gold and silver.The post mortem will be painful. If anyone is hoping it will be long as well, it is the Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who's parlous political position and poor polling has been off the front pages as the nation licks the wounds of a dented ego.@highlightAustralia is currently 19th on the gold medal table with just two golds@highlightFailure to win medals in London has prompted soul-searching@highlightAthletes have criticized local media for putting emphasis on winning gold", "category": "large"}

They had one of the best hitters in the game. They had sharp young pitchers. They were a part of almost every October.But the 1985 World Series comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals was the Royals' last taste of glory until Wednesday, when this year's team rumbled back into the Fall Classic, sweeping the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League Championship Series.For much of the past 29 years, the Royals haven't been a baseball afterthought, they've been a non-thought, except for their loyal fans.There's plenty of room on the Royals bandwagon, so if you're thinking about getting on, here are five things to consider:They're not baseball royaltyIf asked to name one Kansas City Royal, most people would say George Brett.If asked to name a current Royal, most people would be silent.But don't be too embarrassed, this is a team that doesn't have any huge stars. They don't even have many celebrity fans. We think they have one -- actor Paul Rudd.They don't make splashy news in the free agent market. They built a great team through some smart draft picks and augmented the roster through a few nifty trades. But none of the names in the lineup stands out to people who don't closely follow the game.Seriously, had you heard of Lorenzo Cain until October? (He was the most valuable player of the ALCS, by the way)They can pick itIt seems like you can't hit a ball where the Royals ain't. On Wednesday, the Orioles smoked four balls in the first two innings right on the nose. Every one was turned into an out.The game was punctuated by a great catch by Alex Gordon, who slammed into the left-field wall just after his glove swallowed the ball.Before the season, a whole lot of experts said the Royals had some of the best fielders in the majors, but then they made a 104 errors, including a stretch of 35 in 35 games.So far they've had far more great plays than errors (just three in eight games) in a tense and tight postseason.They believeThe Royals haven't lost in the post season since 1985.Well, that's in part because they haven't been in the playoffs since 1985 when they won the last three against the St. Louis Cardinals to win the World Series, four games to three.But check this, they've won 11 straight games in the postseason. All eight this year, most of them of the nail-biting, gotta-get-a-clutch-hit variety. They were four runs down and six outs from being bounced out of the playoffs before it really even started.But they rallied to beat the Athletics in extra innings in a thrilling Wild Card game and dispatched the highly favored Angels with two extra-innings wins and a rare ho-hum easy \"W\" in the division series.They swept the Orioles in four but they only outscored them by six runs.It helps the offense to know the bullpen is going to lock it down so all they have to do is keep it close, third baseman Mike Moustakas said.\"This team just doesn't panic,\" he said.They just have funBo knows. Former Royal Bo Jackson says the kids on this team are a joy to watch.\"It's been a long time since I've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day,\" he told sports host Jim Rome this week. The lack of outward happiness could stem from the huge money that puts pressure on players to perform, he said.Well, the not-so-regally compensated Royals -- they are 18th out of 30 teams in the majors in payroll at $91 million -- don't take the field with high expectations or a lot of pressure. This team has been rebuilding and manager Ned Yost accepts stumbles that come with a youthful team.\"To watch them go through the last couple of years, the ups and the downs and to finally get to this point, I am very proud of them,\" he said.They are dueIt was about a decade ago that the Royals lost 310 games in three years. It wouldn't even be June yet and Royals fans were already ready to give up.You never knew who the Royals fans were in your office because they never had anything to brag on.It's been 29 years since their team had won a playoff game, let alone go to the World Series.

{"question_id": 77, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\n(CNN) -- A Tennessee juror's laudatory Facebook message to a medical examiner during a murder trial could nullify the jury's conviction of William Darelle Smith, the state's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.The high court did not immediately throw out the first-degree murder conviction of Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. But in concluding the trial judge erred upon learning of the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness, state justices unanimously decided a new trial may be necessary unless the state proves the juror shouldn't have been disqualified.\"If, for any reason, the trial court is unable to conduct a full and fair hearing with regard to juror (Glenn Scott) Mitchell's improper extrajudicial communication with Dr. Lewis, then the trial court shall grant Mr. Smith a new trial,\" the Supreme Court ruled, referring to the juror by name, as well as Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified.The Davidson County, Tennessee, District Attorney's Office did not have an immediate reaction Wednesday to the ruling. Smith's public defender declined to comment.A county grand jury indicted Smith in the death of Zurisaday Villanueva, whose body was found June 4, 2007, off a Nashville road along with two .9 millimeter shell casings. The two had been living together, according to court documents.Smith went on trial in March 2010. After the jury was set, jurors were told by the judge they \"should not talk with any witnesses, defendants or attorneys involved in this case.\"Testimony followed, including from Smith's cousin, who said the defendant told her a pistol \"went off\" while he and Villanueva were arguing and again when Smith was trying to move Villanueva's body.The prosecution also presented evidence indicating Villanueva's blood was in an automobile driven by Smith and owned by his father. The second-to-last person to testify for the prosecution was Lewis, a Vanderbilt-trained assistant medical examiner. She conducted an autopsy on Villanueva and classified her death as a homicide, saying Villanueva was shot in the chest and the back of the head.The next day, about an hour after the jury began deliberating on Smith's fate, Lewis e-mailed presiding Judge Seth Norman that she had been contacted via Facebook by a juror who was an acquaintance.\"A-dele!!\" the juror wrote, according to the e-mail included in the state Supreme Court ruling. \"I thought you did a great job today on the witness stand. ... I was in the jury ... not sure if you recognized me or not!! You really explained things so great!!\"Lewis responded by saying she thought she recognized the juror, then warned of \"a risk of a mistrial if that gets out.\" The juror wrote back that he was aware of the risk, saying he hadn't mentioned he knew Lewis.The first time the juror-witness communication came up in official court proceedings was after the verdict was delivered, but before sentencing. That's when public defender Mike Engle asked if the court asked the juror about the exchange, to which the judge replied, \"No, I'm satisfied with the communication that I have gotten with Dr. Lewis with regard to this matter.\"Smith later asked for a new trial, in part because the defense wasn't allowed to question the juror. The trial court ruled against him, as did a state appeals court that characterized the Facebook communication as \"mere interactions\" and noted it is up to the court to decide if a juror is impartial.The state Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday overruled those decisions. Stressing that \"the public's confidence in the fairness of the system\" requires that all jurors be held \"accountable to the highest standards of conduct,\" the justices said the trial court should have taken \"steps to assure that the juror has not been exposed to extraneous information or has not been improperly influenced.\"In Smith's trial, this could have been addressed at a hearing at that time or a \"full-scale investigation,\" the court said. Neither occurred, leading the state Supreme Court to send the case back to the trial court for a hearing on the Facebook communication and the jurors' impartiality.Conversations between jurors and people involved in a case have long been forbidden in state law. But the court admits that technology -- including the Internet, which allows jurors to conduct research and more readily communicate -- has complicated matters.\"Even though technology has made it easier for jurors to communicate with third parties and has made these communications more difficult to detect, our pre-Internet precedents provide appropriate (guidelines),\" the ruling states.The state court also said trial courts need to \"give jurors specific, understandable instructions that prohibit extrajudicial communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence.\"\"Trial courts should clearly prohibit jurors' use of devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to access social media websites or applications to discuss, communicate, or research anything about the trial,\" the court said.CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.@highlightWilliam Darelle Smith went on trial in 2010 for first-degree murder@highlightA doctor who did the victim's autopsy testified, then was contacted by a juror@highlightThe trial judge didn't order a hearing into that interaction; high court says he erred@highlightState Supreme Court orders such a hearing, which could lead to a new trial", "category": "large"}

And while the height has its perks -- \"You don't get picked on as much\"  -- he wishes strangers wouldn't stare.\"I'm another person, just like everybody else,\" said Adams, who doesn't play basketball -- two knee replacements insured that -- and prefers to hang out with friends, camp and ride dirt bikes.The tallest teenage boy is one of about 4,000 records listed in this year's book -- a number that accounts for a mere 10 percent of all the mind-blowing stats that make up the Guinness World Records database, said Stuart Claxton, a spokesman for the organization that began publishing feats in 1955.

As of the last record-setting measurement, her nails were 28-foot long in total, the longest being her left index fingernail that came in at 3-foot, Claxton said.But a car accident in February of this year left her nails broken and her hands much freer, the Guinness spokesman said. iReport.com: World's largest rocking chair?\"They were such a part of her,\" he said, before describing Redmond's attitude as \"very stoic,\" and her take on the broken nails this way: \"If something like that had to happen, it had to happen.

Their differences set aside for the time being, the men hopped into their Pajeros and pulled out, heading to the heart of Falluja.Westerners would typically avoid the downtown area, opting instead for a bypass route around the city, but that morning, the convoy set out on Highway 10, right through the busy streets of the city.There were just two men per vehicle. Two of the men who would have provided rear cover in the vehicles had been held back to help with clerical work. Scott Helvenston and Mike Teague were in one SUV, Wesley Batalona and Jerry Zovko in another, as the convoy drove a little over a mile into town. With traffic coming to a halt, the convoy found itself stuck in a growing swarm of traffic and people.Suddenly, a few armed men emerged from the streets and approached the vehicle that Helvenston and Teague were in. They fired off shots, hitting the Blackwater men in the back of the head, the stricken men's bodies slumping forward in their seats.   Witnesses watched the other Pajero attempting to move out of the way, but it failed to pass through the gathering crowd fast enough. Within minutes of the first attack, Zovko and Batalona were also shot. The crowd began working itself into a frenzy. Locals videotaped as a mob of men and boys began to chant and celebrate, many of them cheering, \"Falluja is the graveyard of Americans.\"The video showed a chilling display of hatred, as the bodies were burned, ripped from the vehicles, beaten and dragged through the streets to a steel bridge spanning the Euphrates River. The crowd was jubilant, chanting like football fans celebrating a Super Bowl victory. A torso, now decapitated, was tied with electrical cord and hung from the girders. A second body, blackened from the fire, was also strung up for the cheering crowd to see.It was sometime between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning in McLean, Virginia, when Erik Prince got the call. In Moyock, North Carolina, Gary Jackson had gotten word of the attack as well. Jackson headed into his office at the Blackwater training facility, where he was joined by Chris Taylor, who had just been promoted to vice president of strategic initiatives, and Mike Rush, the director of Blackwater Security Consulting.   They linked up with Prince by phone, as he arrived at his unmarked office in a McLean high-rise in the dark hours of morning. The details were still sketchy, but they knew that four of their own had been killed.\"I'd been a low-level officer before, but I'd never had anybody under my responsibility seriously injured or killed,\" said Prince. \"That struck home.\"It wasn't long before the images began showing up on TV screens. The pictures shown on Arabic networks were incredibly disturbing: the chanting crowd, the burning vehicles, the bodies hanging from the bridge.

By midmorning, the worst was confirmed. The four men were four of their own. Prince, Jackson, Taylor, and Rush knew what they had to do. Jackson was angry but tried to keep his emotions in check.\"I was pissed; you know, I come from the Special Operations community, and I was mainly just pissed,\" said Jackson. \"You've got to understand at that particular point in time, no matter how bad it was, it was going, and we had stuff to do.\"The four dead men had listed next of kin information in the company paperwork.

{"question_id": 80, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nLos Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after his death, music legend and celebrity icon Michael Jackson's legacy remains clouded by the debate over how he died and who, if anyone, is to blame.A Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the then 50-year-old Jackson, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood, on June 25, 2009.Ever since, there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory, and music, alive. Still, much of the talk about one of the world's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms, centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death.Authorities claim that his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, administered the fatal dose. He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. The doctor's defense attorney, Ed Chernoff, contends Jackson was \"a desperate man in many respects\" and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching.One of Michael's sisters, LaToya Jackson, told CNN's Piers Morgan this week that her brother \"told me that they were going to murder him\" -- identifying \"they\" only as \"the people involved in his life, the people that were controlling him.\"The late singer's father, Joe Jackson, also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with CNN on Saturday.\"We're striving for justice, because there's more to it than they're claiming,\" said Joe Jackson, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray and also said he's still fighting over who controls his son's estate. \"There is somebody else involved.\"The singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, has filed a lawsuit accusing AEG Live of causing her son's death by pushing him to rehearse for his comeback concerts despite poor health. In the suit, she described Jackson in his last months as \"confused, easily frightened, unable to remember, obsessive, and disoriented.\"Yet for all the legal entanglements, the last 24 months has also been marked by numerous attempts to celebrate, give new life to and capitalize on the singer's historic career.According to Forbes, Jackson's estate brought in a whopping $275 million between October 2009 and 2010. The singer's good fortune is due in large part to licensing deals cut by executors of his estate, a surge in sales of his music catalog and the $250 million box office of the Sony Pictures film, \"This Is It.\"That documentary, focused on the singer's preparations for his world tour, came out within months of his death. Sony was under a contractual obligation with Jackson's estate to not use anything that showed the icon in \"a negative light\" -- though Pastor ruled that additional, raw footage could be used in Murray's upcoming trial.In a rare public appearance, two of Jackson's three surviving children -- Prince Michael and Paris -- appeared in January 2010 at the Grammy Awards to help accept a Lifetime Achievement Award on their father's behalf. The singer's music and dance also inspired a Cirque du Soleil show, \"Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour.\"And for months, there's also been talk about a full-length album entitled \"Michael,\" featuring 10 songs and collaborations with rapper 50 Cent and rocker Lenny Kravitz -- including a duet with Akon that was released online last November.But not all such Jackson-related efforts have been directly tied to his music.Mohammed Al Fayed, for instance, helped erect a statue of Jackson to stand outside the stadium of English Premier League football club Fulham, which he owns. The Egyptian-born businessman, who had owned Harrods department store and was a friend of the singer, told fans -- some bemused and others questioning the statue's relevance -- they can \"go to hell\" if they object.Also in England (but not the United States), the Discovery Channel planned to broadcast a special early this year featuring a re-enactment of Jackson's autopsy. But the program, \"Michael Jackson's Autopsy: What Really Killed Michael Jackson,\" was dropped before airing after repeated complaints.Investor Reginald Garcia said this spring that he will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished photos he had taken of a then-19-year-old Jackson to fund testing of a motor that he claims generates more electricity than it uses.And this weekend, the King of Pop's signature red and black jacket with \"winged shoulders,\" which he wore during the filming of the iconic \"Thriller\" music video, was one of several pieces of music memorabilia up for sale at a California auction.In his interview Saturday with CNN, Joe Jackson touted his plan to further develop his son's dream and build amusement parks -- called \"Happyland\" -- around the world. (In the same interview, he also publicized his new \"Jackson\" cologne and vodka, called \"Vodka Precious.\")\"I'm grieving over Michael,\" the late singer's father said. \"It's going to take me a long time to get over what happened to him.\"Katherine Jackson told CNN this past spring that she struggles each day without Michael, even as she cares for his children, whom she has legal custody over.\"There's not a day that passes I don't think about my child, and he should be here right now,\" his mother said.@highlightMichael Jackson died June 25, 2009, of a drug overdose@highlightHis personal doctor is charged with administering the fatal dose@highlightSeveral other lawsuits have been filed regarding his death@highlightThere have also been many attempts to promote and capitalize on his legacy", "category": "large"}
{"question_id": 81, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nWashington (CNN) -- The \"nuclear option\" would be the changing of Senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60.Apparently you need 60 votes to do just about anything in the Senate but change the rules. That only takes 51 votes.Nuclear? That sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change.Senators view themselves as being part of the \"world's greatest deliberative body.\" It's a debatable point, but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate, Senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation. In the fancy language they speak on Capitol Hill, moving toward a vote is called \"invoking cloture.\"Senate moving toward 'going nuclear'Actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes, but because of the procedural rules, it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days. By requiring only 51 votes, the entire character of the chamber would change. Instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party (Republicans right now), the majority party (Democrats right now) would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority.Click here for a good academic paper from George Kroger at the University of Miami on \"The Rise of the 60-Vote Senate\"The idea is that it would \"blow up\" the Senate. We're speaking figuratively, of course.The symbolism of \"going nuclear\" also portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future, to borrow another Cold War term. Democrats won't always control the Senate. And when Republicans are in charge, you can bet they'll return the favor.Man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing itWow. That does sound serious. Is this constitutional?Sure is. The Constitution doesn't say anything about Senate rules. It puts that power in the hands of senators and congressmen.\"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,\" according to Article 1, Section 5.Senators are tasked with signing off on nominees in Article II, Section 2. But it doesn't say how exactly, which has led to a centuries-long debate on the matter.Here's what the Constitution says about the president's power to appoint: \"He shall have Power... with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\"OK. Fine. There's nothing in the Constitution. But Senate rules are pretty clear on the 60-vote threshold.Yes, they are. Read the chapter on cloture.But they've changed over time. Until 1949, for instance, according to the Congressional Research Service, senators couldn't even move to limit debate (invoke cloture) on nominations. According to the Senate website, Henry Clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear, back in 1841, on legislation. Up until 1975, it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster. The most famous examples came during the Civil Rights era when Southerners from both parties blocked equal rights legislation. It took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 Civil Rights Act.What role does filibustering play in all this?Everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is. In pop culture, filibustering brings to mind Jimmy Stewart in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees. Anymore the filibuster is an implied thing. When everybody realizes that if there aren't 60 votes to limit debate, senators don't generally spend much time debating at all. They just move on. Even when a senator mounts a long, all-night speech, the outcome is usually pre-ordained. Take Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown. Even before Cruz started speaking, senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day. His speech was not a filibuster; it was preaching to his political choir.Why is all this coming to a head now?This is where it gets even more complicated. Republicans have been blocking nominees to the D.C. Court of Appeals not because they dislike all the nominees, but because they don't want more Democrats than Republicans on that court. Currently, there are equal numbers of Democratic and Republican appointed judges on the court, which is considered second only to the Supreme Court in importance. In fact, Republicans want to shrink the number of judges on the court and expand the number of judges in other courts.But this is a fight that extends way beyond the current spat over the D.C Circuit Court. The number of filibusters has exploded in recent years, and so has the number of votes trying to end them. Between 1949 and 2012, cloture was invoked 122 times. The vast majority of those occurred in the past decade.Democrats, who employed the tactic of filibustering to some effect during the George W. Bush administration, now say they're fed up with Republicans employing it against President Barack Obama. Read a really detailed look at the history of filibusters and cloture filings from the Congressional Research Service.Republicans block nominees to D.C. court@highlightSenate rules require 60 votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation@highlightUp until 1975, it took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster@highlightSen.

She sits proudly in the pew every Sunday for service and is among the first to arrive for bible study each Wednesday.She moves swiftly, with confidence, a weathered Bible clutched in her right hand, the day's passages dog-eared and highlighted. She's the type of woman who can recite scriptures with ease, her love of faith evident in her speech.\"Every day is a blessed day for me,\" she says. \"Jesus is the No. 1 man in my life and any man who wants me must seek me through Him.\"The unmarried Georgia native is a committed follower of the Christian faith, striving to live and breathe the gospel in her daily life. Yet, according to relationship advice columnist Deborrah Cooper, it is this devout style of belief and attachment to the black church that is keeping black women like Davis -- single and lonely.Clinging to the gospelCooper, a writer for the San Francisco Examiner, recently made claims on her blog SurvivingDating.com that predominantly black protestant churches, such as African Methodists, Pentecostal, and certain denominations of Evangelical and Baptist churches are the main reason black women are single. Cooper, who is black and says she is not strictly religious, argues that rigid beliefs constructed by the black church are blinding black women in their search for love.In raising the issue, Cooper ignited a public conversation about a topic that is increasingly getting attention in the black community and beyond. Oprah Winfrey, among others, recently hosted a show about single black women and relationships after a Yale University study found that 42 percent of African-American women in the United States were unmarried.Big Miller Grove Missionary Baptist Church, a predominately African-American Baptist church in Atlanta, is holding a seminar on the question of faith's role in marital status on August 20.\"Black women are interpreting the scriptures too literally. They want a man to which they are 'equally yoked' -- a man that goes to church five times a week and every Sunday just like they do,\" Cooper said in a recent interview.\"If they meet a black man that is not in church, they are automatically eliminated as a potential suitor. This is just limiting their dating pool.\"The traditional structure and dynamics of black churches, mostly led by black men, convey submissive attitudes to women, Cooper says, encouraging them to be patient -- instead of getting up and going after what they want.Nearly ninety percent of African-Americans express \"certain belief in God\" and 55 percent say they \"interpret scripture literally,\" according to the 2009 Pew Research Center study \"A Religious Portrait of African-Americans.\"Dr. Boyce Watkins, a professor at Syracuse University and advocate for African-American issues, responded to Cooper's article online. Though he applauded Cooper's courage to voice her opinion , he agreed -- and disagreed -- with her.\"I don't think the church keeps black women single,\" Watkins says. \"But I do agree that some black churches teach women that they must only date a man that goes to church regularly.\"Watkins, who is African-American and whose father is a Southern Baptist minister, described his interactions with southern women who are devout churchgoers. \"I am a male and I know that I will treat a woman well, but I have been rejected many times because I don't thump a bible with me everywhere that I go.\"All in the numbersOne of biggest reasons black women are single, Cooper says, is because of a lack of black men in the church. According to the PEW study, \"African-American men are significantly more likely than women to be unaffiliated with any religion (16 percent vs. 9 percent). Nearly one-in-five men say they have no formal religious affiliation.\"Watkins believes the social structure of the church keeps black men from attending. \"Those appealing, high-testosterone guys have a hard time getting into the 'Follow the leader, give me your money, and listen to what I have to say' attitude.\"\"Many of us have a difficult time submitting to the pastor who is just another man.\"The male pastor, Cooper says, is the \"alpha male\" for many black women. Over-reverence for the pastor - or any religious figure for that matter - creates barriers for the black man, she says, because he feels like he must compete for the No. 1 spot in a black woman's heart.\"It doesn't make you more attractive if your life is filled with these 'other' men,\" Cooper says. \"If they feel like they have to compete, you are not going to be interesting because you're not feeding his ego in the way it needs to be fed.\"Mark K. Forston, son of a black preacher in Forest Park, Georgia, says some black women \"put their pastor on this pedestal and have a large amount of faith in him because he is a living source of salvation.\"Sometimes women even focus their romantic feelings on the pastor, says Forston. \"Regardless if he's married or not, sometimes human desires will transcend beyond certain parameters and that's dangerous territory. Pastors are humans just like anybody else.\"The Rev. Renita J. Weems, a bible scholar who holds a degree in theology from Princeton, strongly disagrees with Cooper about why many black women remain single and says she is reinforcing one message: \"It's the black woman's fault.\"\"To claim that women are sitting in their chair getting heated about watching their preacher strut across the pulpit is illogical,\" Weems says. \"The black church is not a Sunday morning sex drama.\"Weems, who is African-American and has written several books on women's spirituality, has her own criticisms of the black church. The literal interpretation of certain scriptures can lead to subjugating women, Weems says. However, positive scripture messages, about love and justice, do exist and can be used to empower women rather than keep them \"single and lonely.\"Weems says Cooper fails to examine deeper threads. \"What the black church does and what religion does is helps you create core values for your life and allows you to see what you appreciate in others.\"The reason why black women who go to black churches are not married is because they are looking for certain values in a man,\" Weems says. \"It is not the church that keeps them single, but the simple fact that good values are lacking in some of our men.\"Choose or lose the churchCooper says her goal is to empower black women. If their strategy for meeting men is failing, Cooper offers two suggestions: Find another church or leave-and go where the boys go: tailgates, bars and clubs.\"Black women need to open their eyes. You want to know the reason why the black man isn't in church? Because he left church to go to the Sunday football game,\" Cooper says. \"Going to these sites is discouraged in the black church because these places are seen as places where 'sin dwells.' But if women are compassionate, as the bible preaches they should be, then they need to be more open about the men they choose to date and where they might meet them.\"\"I'm not against religion, or against the church, I'm against women limiting their choices and putting themselves in a box because they do what their church tells them to do,\" Cooper says.Weems disagrees. \"Telling black women that they should spend their two hours on Sunday elsewhere and drive them away to go to the bar to find a date is not helpful to our communities.\"\"Black women are the backbones of their community and without them a lot of charitable work would not get done, social justice on the ground would be diminished and outreach to poor people would be severed.\"Patty Davis, the long time churchgoer in Georgia, says all the arguments over what the church preaches miss the point. What truly matters, she says, are women's motives.\"The real question is: What are you coming to church for?\" she says. \"To feed your spirit? Or your carnal desires?\"The church's effect on the romantic lives of black women cannot be gleaned from a mathematical equation or a select bible passage, Davis says.\"It is a woman's own actions and decisions that will determine the outcome of her love life, not the church's,\" Davis says. \"Because the last time I checked, the church ain't no dating service.\"@highlightDating advice columnist Deborah Cooper: Black church keeps black women single@highlightPew report: Nearly 55 percent of African-Americans \"interpret scripture literally\"@highlightThe Rev.

{"question_id": 83, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nThe news from Pakistan is generally bad news.In the past week, which was far from atypical, suicide bombers attacked a court building in the northwestern city of Peshawar taking hostages and killing four people.In the southern city of Karachi the director of a renowned social program working in the megacity's poorest neighborhoods was shot and killed. And gunmen kidnapped two female Czech tourists in southwestern Pakistan.But this past week also saw more than a glimmer of good news from Pakistan: Saturday, March 16 marked an extraordinary moment in Pakistani history, as this is the first time  a civilian government has served its entire five-year term (from 2008 to 2013). And, for the first time in its history, the Pakistani military appears unwilling to mount a coup against the civilian government. The military has successfully executed three coups and attempted a number of others since Pakistan's independence in 1947.Today the army understands that the most recent coup by General Pervez Musharraf who took power in 1999 has tarnished its brand.Musharraf hung on to power for almost a decade and his imposition of emergency rule in 2007 triggered massive street protests and eventually his ouster.On Saturday, Musharaf announced he is returning to Pakistan from self-imposed exile on March 24 to run in elections that are to be held two months from now.In a telling sign that Pakistan is moving into something of a new era, Pakistani military officials are not supportive of Musharraf's return and nor is much of the Pakistani public.On May 11, Pakistanis will go to the polls to elect a new civilian government for a five-year term, and there is now a good prospect for continued, uninterrupted civilian government until at least 2018.In terms of Pakistan's long-term health and stability, the fact that the country is in an unprecedented era of lengthy civilian rule will help erode the Pakistani military's present position as having uncontested supremacy in all matters that relate to the country's national security, in particular its relations with India and with Afghanistan.The military has backed insurgent and terrorist groups in India and Afghanistan to maintain its perceived interests in these countries. A more confident civilian Pakistani government will, hopefully, over time be less likely to support these militant groups.Another great opportunity (and potential peril) will present itself in Afghanistan, when Afghans go to the polls in April 2014 for the third presidential election since the fall of the Taliban.If that election is perceived as being relatively free and fair this would go a long way to ease tensions in the Afghan body politic, increase Afghanistan's overall security and reassure both Afghan and outside investors that the country has a promising future.On the other hand, if the 2014 election is seen as unfair, corrupted and is deeply contested, this would likely precipitate a vicious circle of conflict, deteriorating security and capital flight.The United States, therefore, should do everything it can to provide technical and security assistance to make these elections go as well as possible.But unlike what happened in the run-up to the 2009 Afghan presidential election, U.S. officials should not get involved in privately backing certain candidates. This private support had the unintended effect of splitting the opposition to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, as key leaders of the anti-Karzai opposition all believed they were \"America's candidate.\" It also deeply alienated Karzai, whose occasional diatribes against the United States are best understood as due to his lingering resentment over this issue.A key aspect of U.S. and NATO planning for the Afghan presidential elections in April 2014 is that given the fact that there are no discernible front-runners to succeed Karzai, there may be no clear winner who attains more than 50% of the vote, which under Afghan electoral laws would necessitate a runoff election between the two leading candidates.Security, technical and economic assistance for the Afghan elections should be prepared to extend into  summer 2014, because it is not clear as yet when that runoff might be held.Last year the United States and Afghanistan negotiated a Strategic Partnership Agreement, which ensures America will continue to play a supporting role there until 2024.The exact details of what that agreement means in practice are still being hammered out (according to U.S. officials, these negotiations may take until November) but they are likely to include not only significant U.S. aid but also many thousands of American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan for years into the future as a guarantor of the country's stability.The U.S. military has given President Obama a range of options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in Afghanistan after 2014. Those forces would work as advisers to the Afghan army and mount special operations raids against the Taliban and al Qaeda.Whatever the final decision is on troop levels, the key point is that the Obama administration and other U.S. officials should emphasize very clearly that the thousands of American soldiers who will remain in Afghanistan are there to support the United States' long-term partnership agreement with Afghanistan -- and that its life extends well beyond 2014.This is important to emphasize, because Afghans have been understandably confused by some of the different signals the Obama administration has made about its commitment to Afghanistan in the past.Major confusion arose after President Obama's December 2009 announcement of the \"surge\" of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, which was coupled with the announcement that those troops would begin to withdraw beginning in July 2011. In many Afghans' minds, the withdrawal date became more important than the fact that during his first term Obama actually tripled the number of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan from around 30,000 to a total of 90,000.When the Obama administration announces the number of soldiers who will remain in Afghanistan post-2014, it should emphasize that the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan is set to last until at least 2024.This will help in multiple ways: First, this guarantee of a long-term U.S. commitment to Afghanistan will encourage other NATO countries to maintain some of their own troops in Afghanistan to work with the Afghans in areas like training the army and police past the end of the NATO combat mission in December 2014.Such an announcement will also help reassure Afghans that the United States won't be simply turning off the lights in Afghanistan in December 2014. And it will signal to regional powers like Pakistan and Iran that the United States plans to remain engaged in Afghanistan for many years into the future.A key issue facing the Afghan government as the United States draws down its forces is how will the Afghan economy fare? Should the economy collapse, the Afghan government's ability to deal with security issues would be substantially eroded. Already, rents in Kabul are tumbling and nongovernmental organizations are laying off staff.Surprisingly, however, a rigorous and comprehensive World Bank study last year found that Afghanistan will continue to have a healthy growth rate, dropping from its present robust 9% a year rate \"to closer to 5% on average until 2018.\" (The U.S. economy's yearly growth rates over the past four years have been around 2%.)The economic contraction as the United States draws down is likely to be less severe than might be supposed, partly because the hundreds of billions that the U.S. military has spent in Afghanistan over the past decade is spending that almost entirely benefits the United States.The World Bank study points out that \"military spending by the United States (and other countries) finances the salaries of military personnel, investments in weapons equipment and systems. ... The impact of its withdrawal is therefore likely to be muted.\"Another encouraging sign is the investigation of the troubled Kabul Bank, in which some $900 million was lost to fraud, indicating that the culture of impunity for corrupt Afghan officials might be beginning to erode. Earlier this month, 21 officials were found guilty of fraud and two of the former heads of the bank were sentenced to five years in prison. The Afghan Attorney General's office said last week that it would appeal the sentences as being too soft given the scale of the fraud.A key question is the extent to which the Afghan army and police can operate effectively against the Taliban as the United States withdraws. As yet the Afghan army hasn't shown the ability to conduct large-scale operations without significant American support. In addition, a big issue for the army is the extraordinarily high attrition rate.Today, a little more then a quarter of the recruits to the army drop out every year. Because of this high dropout rate, NATO is now considering maintaining the Afghan army and police at its present large size of 352,000 men through 2018. (Estimates of the size of the Taliban typically are in the 25,000 range.)One indicator of the increasingly Afghan-led nature of the fight against the Taliban is the fact that some 300 Afghan soldiers and policemen are now dying every month in the war, while in January three U.S. soldiers were killed, which was the lowest number of any month during the previous four years.On Afghanistan, Pakistan has some important common goals with the United States, NATO and Afghans themselves. Pakistan does not want to see Afghanistan collapse into a renewed civil war, which would destabilize Pakistan, nor does it want to see the Taliban in charge of the country again.When the Taliban was in power in Afghanistan the group resisted Pakistani efforts at control, while the Pakistani Taliban have killed many thousands inside Pakistan. These basic shared goals, no civil war and no Taliban control of Afghanistan, can help to create the conditions for a successful post-2014 AfghanistanPakistan also wants a Pashtun-led government in Kabul and for the Taliban to have some representation in the south and the east. These are also goals the Afghans can live with.Karzai is, after all, a Pashtun and given the fact that Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, the next president of Afghanistan almost certainly will be a Pashtun. And other ethnic minorities can live with a situation in which the Taliban assume a number of provincial and district governorships providing they lay down their arms, join the political process and recognize the Afghan constitution.According to a senior Afghan government official, numerous discussions between representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government have taken place over the past years to discuss such a political accommodation, although, so far, not much of anything has come of these talks.Note: This story is adapted from testimony by Peter Bergen delivered to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 19, 2013.@highlightPeter Bergen: For the first time, Pakistan government served its full term@highlightHe says lack of military coup attempt shows government is more stable than many think@highlightElections in Pakistan, Afghanistan likely to be crucial for those two nations@highlightBergen: He says Afghan economy is resilient and corruption may be receding", "category": "large"}

He's got a surprisingly thorough familiarity with pop culture \u2014 and very little patience for it.Huckabee thinks Miley Cyrus is a bad dancer\u00a0but Beyonce is a good one.He describes Cyrus' 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance as one in which she \"contorted her barely-clad, barely legal-age body in a disgustingly pornographic performance that showed just about everything she had \u2014 except talent \u2014 and focused national attention on a new term, 'twerking,' which describes a vulgar movement better saved for a stripper pole than prime-time television.\"Beyonce, however, is \"incredibly talented ... has an exceptional set of pipes\" and \"is a terrific dancer \u2014 without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom.\" But he didn't like her dance with husband Jay Z during the 2014 Grammy Awards to their song \"Drunk in Love.\"\"Jay-Z is a very shrewd businessman, but I wonder: Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?\" Huckabee wrote of the performance.WATCH: Grammys 2014: PerformancesHe's also not a big fan of Rihanna's style.\"I've seen dusty pickup truck windshields that were less see-through than the mesh 'dress' Rihanna recently 'wore' on the red carpet at a fashion show,\" he noted.(The Council of Fashion Designers of America, which awarded her its 2014 Fashion Icon Award \u2014 an event that prompted the dress \u2014 would probably disagree.)And don't even get him started on reality television, which takes up an entire chapter of his book. Huckabee appears to be familiar with The Real World, Survivor and the Bachelorette \u2014 and has problems with all of them.Later in the book, Huckabee compares a government without checks and balances to \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off on steroids (and boozed up).\"\"[The Founding Fathers] knew that the sheer power of [the government] is an intoxicant and that most of the people who enter government will be like sixteen-year-old boys with keys to the liquor cabinet whose parents are gone for the weekend,\" he writes.Huckabee also name-drops Lady Gaga twice.2. His views on gay marriage are more nuanced than you'd think.Huckabee recounts in the book that he got his introduction to the idea of homosexuality from a Boy Scout troop leader who was molesting members of his troop.\"To be clear, I am not equating all gay men with pedophiles; I'm just relating how this particular person was my introduction to the then-unfathomable concept of same-sex attraction,\" he notes.Describing his outlook as \"God-centered and not man-centered,\" Huckabee offers up some questions on homosexuality:\"Are such variations normal? Which ones? Are there any limits on what is an acceptable attraction? If so, what is the objective basis for those limits, and who gets to draw that line?\"He later adds: \"Is Lady Gaga correct when she sings about being 'Born this Way'?\"And yet, he declares: \"The claim that same-sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated.\"\"Christians who themselves abandoned the primacy of lifelong marriage to follow the divorce and remarriage customs of a secular society have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage,\" he adds.3. He has a soft side.\"I think of myself as a pretty sensitive guy. I'm not callous or cold. I've been known to cry at movies, particularly when a dog dies or a kid gets hurt. That's why I couldn't even see Marley & Me and had to sit in the theater until everyone left before I exited after sitting through My Dog Skip.\"4. He's not particularly pleased with conservative outside groupsHuckabee faced opposition from the Club for Growth during his 2008 run for president, and apparently still holds a grudge. He writes that \"groups like Club for Growth are basically 'pay for play,'\" and says big donors can write checks to the Club and \"it will do the dirty work for you.\"\"It's a coward's way to fight,\" Huckabee writes.Huckabee goes on to compare the battle for conservative purity forged by some of those outside groups to, well, mass-shooters and suicide bombers.\"I really don't think [Fort Hood shooter] Nidal Hasan is the role model the GOP wants to emulate. We should leave the kind of Sunni/Shiite fights for the real jihadists. The goal of conservatives should be to build up America -- not blow up the Republican Party.\"5. He's got a lotta love for some of his potential 2016 opponents \u2014 but disdain for others.Huckabee praises and defends a handful of potential 2016 opponents. He gushes over Mitt Romney, calling him \"a good man with impeccable integrity in his personal and business life,\" praises Rick Perry for recruiting businesses to come to Texas during his time as governor, and defends his work with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Common Core.He makes no mention of Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or Rand Paul, but does implicitly knock the prospect that they all might run for president while serving in the Senate.During his last run, he says, \"I saw others who were sitting members of Congress or the Senate, who would still receive the paycheck plus all their benefits that I helped pay for, and yet never had to show up for work to get the check!\" he writes.\"Nice work if you can get it!\"6. His verdict on the Obamas' parenting skills is still out.Huckabee says that he's \"generally admired the parenting instincts of the First Couple,\" but is appalled that they let their daughters listen to Jay-Z and Beyonce's \"Drunk in Love.\"\"With the First Lady so concerned about making sure her daughters' bellies don't ingest unhealthy food, how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics?\"7. He's allergic to cigarette smoke\"I suppose I'm lucky to be highly allergic to tobacco smoke, because I've never smoked a single cigarette and never wanted to.\"@highlightFormer Arkansas Gov.

{"question_id": 85, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\n(CNN) -- Through English-language propaganda and a vibrant social media presence, ISIS is actively encouraging young Americans to join its cause to take up arms in Syria and Iraq. Some Americans have joined the militant group, according to officials. Intelligence officials fear the number will grow higher since ISIS has been successful with recruitment in some European countries.Americans need to wake up to the frightening reality of this threat taking root in our communities.While President Barack Obama searches for a strategy to confront ISIS in Syria and Iraq, federal, state and local governmental organizations (including law enforcement agencies) and communities are already working together to confront the problem with this group now calling itself the Islamic State.The situation of young people acquiring radicalized beliefs without yet committing crimes is worrisome. The question is: How do we prevent violent ideologies from taking hold of people in the first place, and how to intervene and dissuade them from crossing the line towards actual violence?Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISISThe term used to describe this effort is \"countering violent extremism,\" or CVE. Similar to community-oriented policing methods, CVE focuses on engagement and partnership with communities. CVE stems from the White House's national security strategy and has the active support of multiple federal agencies, but it is highly dependent on cities, counties and states to devise solutions.Consider what is happening in Los Angeles.In 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department established a Liaison Section of its Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau. Its mission is \"to improve the quality of life and public safety within diverse communities by building mutual partnerships and trust through coordination and collaboration of all department entities, government stakeholders, public/private/faith-based organizations, nongovernmental organizations with local communities.\"For example, the LAPD began holding a quarterly Muslim Forum. Each forum is held in a mosque and hosts about two dozen representatives from Muslim organizations throughout the greater Los Angeles area where they join for dialogues.Police officers and Muslim-American community advocates in Los Angeles believe that the program has been successful. They report that the LAPD has been able to engage multiple, key organizations and leaders in the communities and to form partnerships that build trust, challenge misinformation, educate people, promote transparency, defuse conflicts, open communication channels and solve daily problems.Community advocates said they are being regarded as part of the solution, not part of the problem. Deputy Chief Michael Downing, the commanding officer of the Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau, stipulates that law enforcement-community partnerships are essential to the objective of \"making the environment hostile to violent extremism.\"One of the department's key partners is the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), whose director, Salam al-Marayati, believes that law enforcement and community leaders must play distinct roles in the collaborative fight against violent extremism. He sees prevention as primarily the responsibility of communities, and many community members readily agree.MPAC is rolling out \"Safe Spaces,\"  an innovative community-led CVE initiative in mosques across the United States.Safe Spaces aims to increase Muslim-American communities' resilience against violent extremism through community-led prevention and intervention activities.Safe Spaces works in part through getting families and communities to talk together about difficult topics. It tells parents about the threats of recruitment and radicalization to violence. According to its facilitator's guide, \"We're not sharing this story to scare you; only to highlight the serious need for communities to build healthy and safe spaces.\" The initiative teaches helpful strategies to increase parental involvement and supportive adult mentorship for youth.Another key component of Safe Spaces is helping communities form \"crisis inquiry teams\" that can identify individuals believed to be at risk of engaging in violent beliefs and help them turn away from that path. Communities learn that if those efforts fail, and the risk of violent behavior becomes real, then they are obligated to notify law enforcement.Across the United States, new strategies are being developed. In Montgomery Country, Maryland, the effort is not being led by the police but rather through a public-private partnership involving the faith-based community and law enforcement. In Dearborn, Michigan, initiatives aim to promote public safety without singling out terrorism or any one ethnic community.What most efforts have in common is establishing innovative public-private partnerships that increase mutual trust, build capacities, strengthen resilience and then develop and evaluate community-delivered prevention and intervention activities.Opinion: When Americans leave for jihadMost communities don't have such experiences, so there is a need for expanding training and technical assistance that draws on community policing practices and on the lessons learned from implementing programs such as Safe Spaces.With the growing threat of recruitment to ISIS, the U.S. government needs to build on the successes in these and other cities, as well learn from the successes of countries such as Australia, Canada and Britain.We have to figure out how to increase knowledge of CVE strategies; how to accelerate implementation efforts throughout the United States; and how to measure the relative effectiveness of different CVE initiatives.@highlightISIS is encouraging Americans to join its cause to take up arms in Syria and Iraq@highlightStevan Weine: We must find ways to prevent this threat from taking root in our communities@highlightHe says the key is to stop young people from acquiring radicalized beliefs@highlightWeine: Communities in the U.S. are partnering with Muslim groups to promote public safety", "category": "large"}

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.\"What raises concerns about this news circulated by the media is our serious fear that some of the countries backing terrorism and terrorists might provide the armed terrorist groups with chemical weapons and claim that it was the Syrian government that used the weapons,\" SANA quoted the letters as saying.U.S. officials have said they have seen intelligence suggesting that Syrian military units may be preparing chemical weapons for use.President Barack Obama has said any use of chemical weapons would cross a \"red line,\" eliciting swift U.S. reaction.The United States and European allies are using defense contractors to train Syrian rebels to secure chemical weapons stockpiles, a senior U.S. official and several senior diplomats said.The training, in Jordan and Turkey, covers the monitoring and securing of stockpiles of weapons and materials, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the issue.Some contractors are working with rebels in Syria to monitor sites, one of the officials said.Opposition groups said fighting continued Monday across the country.At least 142 people died Monday, 59 of them in Aleppo and 50 in Damascus and its suburbs, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.In one Aleppo neighborhood, opposition activists said, they discovered 10 handcuffed and blindfolded corpses killed by government forces in recent weeks, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.CNN is unable to confirm casualty reports as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists.The Observatory said a rebel group seized control of a government military base in northwest Syria.The seizure occurred in Aleppo province, where rebel fighters from the jihadi al-Nusra Front, Muhikiri al-Sham and the al-Battar battalions took over three brigades and the command center of the 111th regiment in the Sheikh Sleiman area of western Reef Aleppo, the observatory said.Two rebels and one soldier died; five other soldiers were captured, it said, adding that 140 soldiers and their officers fled.The rebel forces represent a variety of interests. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday that U.S. officials were concerned \"that al-Nusra is little more than a front for al Qaeda in Iraq who has moved some of its operations into Syria.\"The State Department is planning to designate al-Nusra Front, a radical Islamist group, as a foreign terrorist organization, two U.S. officials told CNN last week.The announcement is likely to come this week, the officials said.The hope is to finalize the designation before the Friends of Syria meeting, which is slated to be held Wednesday in Morocco.The goal of the designation is to isolate extremists groups in Syria while giving a boost to the new political opposition group unveiled last month in Doha, Qatar, they said.Al-Nusra and several other groups announced their opposition to a new anti-government coalition last month. U.S. officials estimate al-Nusra members represent some 9% of rebel forces in Syria.Officials said the group has not affiliated itself publicly with al Qaeda in an apparent effort to appear more mainstream.In recent months, the al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere.It has claimed responsibility for a number of complex attacks in Damascus and Aleppo, frequently involving suicide bombers.CNN's Elise Labott and Samira Said contributed to this report.@highlight\"Those responsible will be held accountable\" for use of chemical weapons, EU says@highlightAt least 142 people are killed Monday across Syria, the opposition says@highlightSyria accuses the United States of setting it up to be framed on chemical weapons", "category": "large"}
{"question_id": 87, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\n(CNN) -- Two health care workers went to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with a patient confirmed to have Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, officials said Tuesday.The Florida patient represents the second confirmed case of MERS brought into the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. MERS is a mysterious virus that can be fatal, and was first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012.One health care worker in Orlando began showing symptoms 72 hours after exposure to the MERS patient but did not meet criteria for admission and was sent home, said Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where the MERS patient is being treated. The health care worker will be monitored and seems to be improving, Crespo said.The other one, whose symptoms began 24 hours after exposure, was admitted to the same hospital, officials said Tuesday at a press conference.\"We're just waiting for the results from the testing that was done yesterday to decide about discharge,\" Crespo said.At-risk workers at homeThe two health care workers are among 20 in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient, and they are being tested for the virus, officials said. They were all notified and told to stay home and not work for 14 days, Crespo said. They also should monitor their temperatures and check for possible symptoms such as a cough, sore throat and fever.Five health team members who may be at risk have been identified at Orlando Regional Medical Center and 15 at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, Crespo said.They were all evaluated for signs and symptoms that would be consistent for MERS. Samples were sent to the state lab for testing, said Dr. Ken Michaels, medical director for occupational health at Orlando Health.\"I'm glad to report that I've spoken to most of these team members today. They all report that they're doing great,\" Michaels said.On the 14th day, everyone involved will be brought back for further testing. Once medically cleared, they can return to work, officials said.Initial testing should be back within the next day or two, Michaels said.MERS: 5 things to knowTwo confirmed U.S. casesThe confirmed MERS patient visited Orlando Regional Medical Center on May 5, accompanying another person who was having a medical procedure, officials said.\"I think the risk is negligible to those in the waiting room or the radiology area at (Orlando Regional Medical Center),\" said Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County.The MERS patient was admitted to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital on May 9.\"Before the patient came to the hospital, he was not having a cough,\" Crespo said. \"He was not having respiratory symptoms. So we believe that that makes less risk of transmission to other potential contacts.\"Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating the MERS case.During a White House briefing Tuesday, press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS situation in the United States and that the CDC is taking the lead.The first U.S. case was reported this month in Indiana. That patient was released from a hospital Friday into home isolation, according to state health officials.The Indiana patient was an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia and was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family.The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said that he is not a U.S. citizen and that the Florida case is not linked to the Indiana one.The U.S. Transportation Security Administration will post CDC advisories at more than 20 U.S. airports to alert travelers about the virus.Although there are no recommendations to change travel plans, the signs will advise travelers to the Arabian Peninsula to avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often. They should contact a doctor if they develop symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing, the CDC said.\"We think it's really critical to avoid overreacting in the community but also avoid under-reacting in the health care environment,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"The reason for the signage is so that we can promptly identify potential cases so that they can be separated from other people.\"Can SARS lessons prevent a MERS virus outbreak?What is MERS?As of Friday, there have been 538 cases of MERS in 17 countries, including 145 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, Schuchat said.The virus is also known as MERS-CoV since it is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure.There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS. Doctors said they believe the Indiana patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better.The \"risk to the general public remains very low,\" Schuchat said. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person, but only in close contact, such as a person who was caring for an ill person.\"This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings,\" she said.Out of \"an abundance of caution,\" the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said.No cases of MERS have been diagnosed as a result of transmission on a plane, the CDC's Dr. Marty Cetron said.The 44-year-old Florida patient traveled on May 1 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London, then from London to Boston, Boston to Atlanta, and finally Atlanta to Orlando.The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah, with symptoms including \"fever, chills and a slight cough,\" Schuchat said.Family members of the patient have been tested as well, Crespo said.\"The patient has been doing very well,\" Crespo said. The patient had a low-grade fever of 100.2 on Monday night but has a minimal cough, and he is \"in great spirits.\"MERS mystery: Virus found in camelsCNN's Miriam Falco, Elizabeth Cohen, Jen Christensen, and Athena Jones contributed to this report.@highlightNEW: TSA will put up advisories about MERS in airports@highlightTwo cases have been confirmed in the U.S.@highlightAt least 20 health care workers told to not come to work@highlightThey can return to work after 14 days if medically cleared", "category": "large"}
{"question_id": 88, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nSan Diego (CNN) -- Mitt, we hardly knew ye.Or should I say, \"primo!\" As much as it embarrasses me to admit it, given some of his views and how he expresses them, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and I could be distant cousins. Romney's father, George, was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and so was my grandfather, Roman.Que? You didn't know that Mitt Romney was half-Mexican? It's true. In fact, if he makes it to the White House, in addition to becoming the first Mormon in the Oval Office, he could also be the nation's first Hispanic president.Don't laugh. Technically, Romney is just as \"Mexican\" as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was born of a Mexican mother and American father. When Richardson ran for the White House in 2008, he was often touted by the media as someone who would become the nation's first Hispanic president.Yet, I would imagine that a lot of Americans aren't aware of this branch of the Romney family tree, and that's because it is not a detail that Romney usually talks about publicly -- and especially not on the campaign trail.That changed this week when Romney -- in talking about his father, a self-made man who worked his way up from nothing to become head of American Motors Corporation, governor of Michigan and a Republican presidential candidate in 1968 -- told a crowd at the Rochester Opera House in New Hampshire that his father was born in Mexico and came to the United States at 5.Romney's great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney, fled the United States and crossed into Mexico in 1885 to escape religious persecution. He helped build the Mormon enclave of Colonia Juarez in Chihuahua.Miles Park Romney never became a Mexican citizen, and neither did his son, Gaskell, or grandson, George. They were all denied Mexican citizenship because statutes on the books in Mexico denied that right to American settlers and their offspring.Speaking to the crowd in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney compared his father's story to those of countless other immigrants who have come to this country seeking economic opportunity.My grandfather, a Mexican citizen, also came to the United States legally as a child in the early 1900s with his family, trying to escape the chaos of the Mexican Revolution. It was during the same time that Romney's grandfather, Gaskell, returned to the United States with his family, also legally and presumably for the same reasonNow, hold on to your sombrero.I'm an American, born in the United States to parents who were born in the United States. In fact, three of my four grandparents were born in the United States. And yet, growing up, people in my hometown in Central California referred to me and other Mexican-Americans like me as \"Mexican.\" That was the shorthand. But comparing bloodlines, you could say that Romney is more \"Mexican\" than I am. After all, Romney is just one generation removed from our ancestral homeland; I'm two.This is ironic given that I've spent the last 20 years criticizing politicians who twist the facts, propose simple solutions and pick on those who don't have a voice.And Romney has spent the last several months doing precisely that, just like he did during his failed 2008 presidential bid. He has used illegal immigration as a weapon against Republican opponents who propose reasonable solutions and in the process portrayed illegal immigrants, most of whom come from Mexico, as takers who come to the United States for free public benefits and ought not be rewarded with \"amnesty.\"We can expect Romney to continue that theme over the next week as he campaigns in South Carolina, where Republican primary voters will cast ballots on January 21 and where illegal immigration is a bigger issue than in Iowa or New Hampshire.Lawmakers in the Palmetto State recently passed a tough Arizona-style immigration law that requires local and state police to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect to be an illegal immigrant (read: Latinos).It's an approach that is wildly unpopular with Latinos and which has the blessing of most of the Republicans running for president, including Mitt Romney.And that's one reason why Romney, even if he is the GOP nominee for president, doesn't have much of a chance with Latino voters. Political experts say that a Republican would have to earn at least 30% of the Latino vote to win the White House. Given how he behaved in the primaries, Romney will be lucky to get 20%.In fact, a recent poll of Latino voters by the Pew Hispanic Center put the figure at 23%. While it found a high level of anger with President Barack Obama among Latinos over his aggressive deportation policies, the poll also found that -- in a Obama-Romney matchup -- the Democrat would easily beat the Republican, 68% to 23%. That's saying something given that, according to the survey, Obama's job approval rating with Latinos is just 49%. The takeaway: You want to make Obama more popular with Latinos? Easy. Pit him against Romney.Listen to Lionel Sosa, a San Antonio-based advertising executive and Republican strategist who has advised George W. Bush and John McCain. A few months ago, Sosa told The New York Times that Romney had blown his chance with Latinos.\"(Romney) can make as many trips to Florida and New Mexico and Colorado and other swing states that have a large Latino population,\" said Sosa, \"but he can write off the Latino vote.\"It was Romney who recently promised to veto the Dream Act if he's elected president and if Congress passes the bill. The legislation, which would allow undocumented students to stay in the country legally if they complete a college degree or join the military, is extremely popular with Latinos.It was Romney who first attacked Texas Gov. Rick Perry for signing a law that allows illegal immigrants who live in Texas to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. And it was Romney who later attacked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for declaring that the GOP shouldn't support splitting up families and proposing a pathway for the undocumented to work legally in the United States.It was Romney who, in the debates, came across as naive by suggesting that the illegal immigration problem could be solved by simply putting more \"boots on the ground\" and as dishonest by not acknowledging the contributions that illegal immigrants make to the local, state and national economies.And it was Romney whose campaign put up, in New Hampshire, an offensive television ad that attacked Perry by linking him to Mexico and former Mexican President Vicente Fox, because Fox happened to agree with the Texas governor on letting illegal immigrants pay in-state tuition.So the candidate who winds up vilifying Mexico is the same one whose father was born in Mexico? Who can make sense of this?Listen up, Primo Mitt. You've made your bed. You're persona non grata with Latino voters, and it's your own fault. You can't win without them, but they can help make sure you lose.We don't care where your family's from. What matters is where your heart is.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.@highlightMitt Romney told a crowd in New Hampshire of his father's Mexican roots@highlightRuben Navarrette says it's fair to say Romney could be first Hispanic president@highlightYet he says Romney won't get allegiance of Latino voters because of immigration stance@highlightPoll of Latino voters shows President Obama would have huge edge over Romney", "category": "large"}
{"question_id": 89, "text": "Summarize the given news in less than 150 words while preserving high coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance.\n\nWashington (CNN) -- In what amounted to political theater rather than legislative action, the Senate on Wednesday rejected a House budget plan that included a controversial provision to overhaul Medicare and also unanimously voted down President Barack Obama's 2012 budget proposal.The House budget measure had been expected to fail in the Senate due to overwhelming opposition by majority Democrats, plus wavering support for its Medicare overhaul among Republicans. The Senate GOP has recognized the provision's unpopularity with senior citizens enrolled in the government-run health insurance program.Senate Democrats forced Wednesday's vote in order to make Senate Republicans go on record in support of the Medicare overhaul.The final vote on the proposal originated by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, was 57-40, mostly along party lines. Republicans who joined the majority Democrats in opposing the measure were Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine.Three senators didn't vote -- Republicans Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Pat Roberts of Kansas, and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York.In a later retaliatory vote forced by Republicans, the Senate achieved rare bipartisan unanimity in rejecting Obama's budget plan on a 97-0 vote. The defeat was expected.Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the plan to signal they wanted a stronger deficit reduction proposal than what the president offered.The Senate then defeated two other Republican budget plans offered by conservative newcomers Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Paul.Ryan's plan, which won approval in the House due to strong Republican support, drew the most attention of the proposals defeated Wednesday because of its provision to rework Medicare starting in 2022.On Tuesday, Democrats won a special election for a U.S. House seat from upstate New York formerly considered safe Republican territory, and the Republican Medicare plan was the central issue of the campaign.Under the Ryan proposal, the government would no longer directly pay health care bills for senior citizens in the program, starting in 2022. Instead, recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers, which the federal government would subsidize. People now 55 or older would not be affected by the changes.The budget proposal also would slash non-military discretionary spending and reform Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor and disabled.Republicans call Ryan's proposal a courageous attempt to address runaway spending that must be corralled to bring down rising deficits and a ballooning national debt.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Democrats for stopping \"at nothing to preserve the status quo in Washington, which is propelling our country towards bankruptcy.\"Priebus' remarks reflected the fact that the question of how to tackle the growth of hugely popular entitlement programs -- including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- has now become one of the central battlegrounds in the national political arena.Democrats, however, contend Republicans seek to reduce deficits on the backs of the elderly and the poor by essentially ending Medicare as it now operates. They note the Medicare overhaul will cost senior citizens an average of roughly $6,000 more per year for health care.\"The Republican plan would kill Medicare,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Wednesday.Democrats pointed to the New York special election results on Tuesday as evidence that the American people, especially senior citizens, don't agree with the Republican approach.In the election, Kathy Hochul, the Democratic clerk of Erie County, swept to victory in the race to fill the U.S. House seat previously held by Republican Chris Lee in a district controlled by the GOP for more than four decades.During Hochul's victory speech Tuesday night, jubilant supporters repeatedly chanted \"Medicare! Medicare!\" Hochul pledged to help balance the budget \"the right way, not on backs of our seniors.\"Throughout the campaign, Hochul highlighted the national fight, telling CNN that her Republican opponent, Jane Corwin, had \"100% embraced\" the plan.Corwin called Hochul's message \"scare tactics,\" and had argued that Hochul was \"trying to put out the idea that I'm trying to end Medicare.\"\"There's nothing further from the truth,\" Corwin insisted. \"I'm working to protect Medicare.\"Moments after Hochul's victory was announced, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the newly installed head of the Democratic National Committee, declared that the outcome of the race proves \"Republicans and independent voters, along with Democrats, will reject extreme policies.\"On Wednesday morning, Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, released a statement arguing that the results \"provide clear evidence that Senate Democrats will be able to play offense in Senate races across the country by remaining focused on the Republican effort to end Medicare.\"For their part, Republican leaders minimized the importance of the race. Among other things, they pointed to the presence of a conservative third-party candidate in the race whose support apparently exceeded Hochul's margin of victory.Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said his party has to promote its budget policies and the Medicare overhaul proposal instead of voting for it and then absorbing Democratic attacks.\"The talking point is there was a third-party candidate who drew 12% and spent $2 million,\" Thune said of the New York race, adding that supporters of the Ryan plan in the House and Senate now \"need to get out there and aggressively get on offense and explain it to the American people.\"To Thune, the Republicans made a courageous vote and now Democrats are \"starting to lob grenades at us and everybody's starting to duck and run for cover.\"\"I don't think that's the way you engage in a fight,\" Thune said. \"We have to get out there and fight.\"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said the real problem is that Democrats have failed to propose or pass a budget proposal for last year or this one.\"This is a complete and total abdication of their responsibilities,\" McConnell said.To hit back at Democrats, McConnell forced votes Wednesday on the other three budget measures, including Obama's 2012 budget proposal.McConnell sought to force Democrats to publicly oppose Obama's plan and to also reject other Republican proposals in order to portray them as obstructing any progress on cutting deficits.In a bit of political irony, GOP leaders last year repeatedly attacked the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats, arguing that it would weaken Medicare. Republican congressional candidates crushed their Democratic counterparts among voters age 65 and older in the November congressional elections, carrying seniors by a 21-point margin.Whether Republicans can now successfully defend Ryan's plan, which is a virtual litmus test for their conservative base, without scaring older voters remains to be seen.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, now a presidential candidate, was recently excoriated by conservative activists for calling Ryan's plan a form of objectionable \"right-wing social engineering.\" Gingrich has since backed away from his remarks and expressed support for the proposal.CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this story.@highlightNEW: President Obama's 2012 budget proposal is defeated on a 97-0 vote@highlightFive Republicans join Democrats in voting down the Medicare overhaul plan@highlightDemocrats force the vote to record Republican support@highlightThe Medicare overhaul is opposed by many senior citizens", "category": "large"}

No other details were given about Berry.The 21-year-old rapper was based in Atlanta, Georgia. He was in Los Angeles to work on his debut album.Those who knew him said that despite coming from a rough background, Burton was extremely gracious and polite.\"Everything with Dolla was 'please' and 'thank you,' \" said Ant Rich, manager of A&R for Jive Records, who discovered the rapper for the label when Burton was 17 and helped sign him a year later. \"The streets did not define him at all. He was bigger than that.\"Dolla was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of singer Akon, who collaborated with him on his first single, \"Who the F--- is That?\" which also featured another high-profile artist, T-Pain. Another Dolla song, \"Feelin' Myself,\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 movie \"Step Up.\"According to his official MySpace page, Dolla was born in Chicago, Illinois, and his family relocated to Los Angeles soon after.He was 5 years old when he and his older sister, Divinity, witnessed their father committing suicide. After that incident, their mother moved the family to Atlanta, according to his biography.The Burton family released the following statement on Tuesday:\"First and foremost we, the family, would like to thank everyone for all their kind thoughts and prayers. Furthermore, the family would like to note that rumored details of the shooting on popular Web/blog sites are false.\"Due to the circumstances of the situation, no other information will be released at this time. We are grateful for your continuous support and would be very appreciative if we could mourn this loss in private.\"Additionally, information released before and after this official statement are not confirmed nor should they be considered accurate.\"Rich said Dolla, who also did some modeling for P. Diddy's Sean John label, loved his family deeply. He was the guy with the great smile who would do things like offer to pick up the bill after a meeting with music executives, Rich said.\"You would tell him 'Look Dolla, you don't have to do that because we get reimbursed for this' and he would say 'No, no you got it last time, let me,' \" Rich said. \"The world lost a really good kid and he had the biggest heart.\"DeAngelo Jones books talent for BET and got to know Dolla after he performed at the network's \"Spring Bling\" event last year.He said the artist was humbled and grateful for the success he was starting to find in the industry.\"That energy was what drew me to him,\" said Jones, who stayed in touch with Dolla after the show and often ran into him at other events. \"A lot of times there are negative associations that go along with being a rapper, but he was not at all what the image of a rapper is portrayed to be.\"Jones said he was at the Beverly Center only a short time before the shooting occurred. Jones said it was unfortunate that Dolla's slaying is yet another incident that will link hip-hop with violence.\"Hip-hop gets such a bad rap, ever since the deaths of Biggie and Tupac,\" Jones said. \"[Dolla] just wanted to be successful, help other people and do the right thing. What's so hard for me is to see where his life was heading, because he was definitely on the right course.\"Jerry Barrow, senior editor for The Urban Daily, a publication devoted to African-Americans in pop culture, noted that it was unfortunate that Dolla is finding mainstream recognition posthumously.\"With his modeling and his music, he did more before the age of 20 than many people do,\" Barrow said. \"It's a shame that this is how many people are now discovering him and his music.\"Rashan Ali, a disc jockey with Atlanta's Hot 107.9 radio station, said the city has a thriving hip-hop community. Her station, which plays hip-hop, often has its lobby filled with aspiring artists trying to get their music heard.With the success of Atlanta-based artists like rappers T.I., Outkast, and Young Jeezy, more and more young people are drawn to the area to try and make the connections that will find them fame, Ali said.That Dolla was killed while pursuing his craft is especially sad, she said.\"[Dolla] was minding his business, in Los Angeles trying to record his music and this happens,\" Ali said. \"It's horrific and now a mother has to bury her child. It's senseless.\"@highlightThose who knew rapper Dolla mourn his loss@highlightThe Atlanta-based rapper was killed at the Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles@highlightFamily releases a statement asking for privacy to mourn@highlightDolla, whose real name was Roderick Anthony Burton II, was 21", "category": "large"}
